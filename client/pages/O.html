			<h4><b><u>Introduction</b></u></h4>
			<p>An opportunity refers to a favorable set of circumstances in the external environment creating a need or opening for a new business concept. It is a gap or hole in the marketplace. The existence of an opportunity suggests an unmet or insufficiently met customer need.  It is a situation where something can be improved or done differently at a profit. Entrepreneurs look for the presence of “pain” or dissatisfaction in the marketplace that can be removed with a new product or service that is different or better than what currently exists. </p>
			<p>Entrepreneurial opportunities are abundant, perhaps more so than at any time in history. New technologies, rapid social change, heterogeneous markets, changing demographics, and highly mobile resources, among other factors, contribute to a the constaint emergence of new gaps or openings that can be capitalized upon by entrepreneurs. But is this the case for those experiencing poverty? Certainly if one focuses on their immediate surroundings, the opportunities can be limited, but they exist. The bigger issue is the ability to recognize opportunities that extend beyond those surroundings.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>

			<h4><u>The Nature of Opportunity</u></h4>
			<p>The challenge for many low-income entrepreneurs is that they start with an idea for a business without a clear sense of the underlying opportunity.  Hence, they start a cleaning service, or purchase a truck for the purpose of providing a moving service, and just assume that there is enough of a market opportunity to support their new venture. In fact, by focusing too much on the particular business idea, they often constrain the possible opportunities they might have been able to capitalize upon.</p>
			<p>While they come in all shapes and sizes, there are four general categories of opportunities, each of which readily applies to someone in poverty.  Perennial opportunities that are those that are always there.  They concern the potential to find customers who will pay to have something done cheaper, quicker, with higher quality, more reliably, or incrementally better than it is being done at present. For example, the need for transport services is ongoing in urban areas, and the entrepreneur who can move people or packages on a timelier basis or at a lower price is pursuing a perennial opportunity.  Occasional opportunities occur based on situational developments, such as natural disaster, introduction of a new capability, withdrawal from the market of a key supplier, demand surge, new regulation, emergence of a new market segment, or existence of a market hole. An example is the need for generators, building materials, or tree removal services after a hurricane or tornado. Multiple cause opportunities emerge based on a confluence of developments in the external environment.  For instance, if there are more single mothers who are working full time and are also worried about how much exercise their children are getting, the combination of these three developments may represent an opportunity for some new type of neighborhood recreational service.  Multiple effect opportunities emerge when a particular development in the external environment opens a number of new possibilities simultaneously. The launch of smart phones created new opportunities for car sharing, delivering educational courses, providing patient care, monitoring employee activities, and scheduling deliveries, among many others.</p>
			<p>Opportunities can be big or small and attractive or unattractive. Seven factors go into delineating something as an entrepreneurial opportunity.  These include: (a) identifying particular forces in the external environment that drive or create the opportunity; (b) defining a customer need and understanding associated  customer perceptions; (c) specifying the boundaries on the market being served and the distinct customer segments being focused upon; (d) estimating market size (potential units or sales revenue); (d) delineating the window of time during which the opportunity can be successfully capitalized upon; (e) recognizing the strength of customer loyalties to existing products or services that could address the same need and the associated customer switching costs; and (g) determining the nature, extent, and aggressiveness of current competitors.</p>
			<p>For the low-income entrepreneur, a significant challenge concerns actually determining the size or attractiveness of an opportunity. This is generally more art than science. Far too often, the actual opportunity is much smaller than the entrepreneur assumed or estimated---forcing the business to fail or quickly adapt toward a different opportunity. While they may lack access to extensive databases or sophisticated methodologies for quantifying how much of an opportunity exists, it is important that these entrepreneurs interview customers, visit and conduct research on competitors, talk to suppliers, and otherwise develop insights on the scope of the available opportunity.</p>
			<p>In practice, the opportunities pursued by low income entrepreneurs are often smaller and/or less attractive, and center on more basic customer needs.  They can be limited due to the presence of multiple competitors, a lack of barriers to entry, and a limited potential customer base made up of users who are more price sensitive. Further, even where the overall opportunity appears to be sizeable, the entrepreneur is only able to compete for a very small and often marginal piece of what might be available because of resource and capacity constraints. The key to changing such tendencies begins with rethinking how the entrepreneur recognizes and defines opportunity.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Uncovering Opportunities</u></b></h4>
			<p>How does the entrepreneur uncover an opportunity?  It is critical that we recognize that, even for someone in poverty, opportunities are everywhere---they just need to be seen. The beginning point is to understand the principal sources of opportunities.  Opportunities derive from developments in the external environment. Consider some examples:</p>
			<p>•The passing of new laws or regulations, such as the lengthening of the school day, legalization of marijuana, banning of smoking in public areas, or requirements that cars be inspected;</p>
			<p>•Demographic changes such as the aging of the boomer population, the growth of the immigrant population, an increase in single parent households, or the decline of the middle class;</p>
			<p>•Technological developments such as smartphone apps, miniaturization of electronic components, 3D printing, drones, telemedicine, and touch technology that create new capabilities or possibilities;</p>
			<p>•Social trends that capture changes in people’s behaviors, habits, values, perceptions and beliefs. For example, people eating healthier, a preference for home schooling, concerns about environmental degradation, or a growing tendency for students to move home after college or get married later;</p>
			<p>•Changes in supplier and labor markets, such as the employee desire for flex time or to work remotely, the ability to outsource key activities, the availability of third-party logistics companies, and the emergence of new supply or distribution channels;</p>
			<p>•Underserved or poorly-served markets, perhaps due to their remote location, weak infrastructure, supply shortages, poor economic conditions, lack of competition, or high crime rates;</p>
			<p>•Unexpected occurrences, including natural disasters (e.g., flood, drought), war, a prolonged labor strike, pandemic disease, among many other possibilities.</p>
			<p>Entrepreneurs are engaged in pattern recognition, using mental tools to recognize meaningful patterns from developments in the external environment, and structural alignment, where they make comparisons in order to detect common and contrasting aspects between events. While sometimes uncovered through a process of deliberate search, they are often stumbled upon in the course of everyday life.  The entrepreneur observes these sorts of patterns, developments or cues and begins to ask such questions as “what problems or needs does this change produce?”, “what does this change enable me to do that previously might not have been possible?”, and “how can I make money from this change?”. It is through the process of addressing these kinds of questions that the entrepreneur is able to identify a potential market opportunity.</p>
			<p>If opportunities derive from developments in the external environment, then the environment surrounding those in poverty plays a critical role in determining what kinds of opportunities they are able to discern or recognize. The key, then, is to understand the critical aspects of the context within which the individual might launch a business, and how this context affects the tendency to recognize promising opportunities.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Opportunity Alertness and the Poor</u></b></h4>
			<p>The concept of entrepreneurial alertness refers to the ability of a person to notice opportunities overlooked by others. When individuals are more alert, they demonstrate a better ability to uncover and clarify gaps and cues in the environment, as if they have an “antenna” that continually recognizes stimuli that represent opportunities (Tang, Kacmar, and Busenitz 2012).  Alertness is built upon a person’s interpretation framework (which is reflective of their perceptual and cognitive processing skills and the mental schemas they rely upon), stock of knowledge, and everyday life experiences. Further, there is a greater tendency for opportunities to be recognized in areas of stronger interest, passion or vocation. People’s attention is directed to things that they are on the lookout for and, accordingly, are able to more clearly perceive.</p>
			<p>The implication is that opportunity recognition is an idiosyncratic process. The poor are no different than others in that some are more entrepreneurially alert and some are less so. Different individuals exposed to the same information may recognize different business opportunities, even when they have similar backgrounds and come from similar contexts. Further, alertness is a variable that can change over time, such that levels of alertness can be increased among the poor.  It is impacted by personal traits that may be less amenable to change, but also by motivational incentives (e.g., inability to find a job or to support one’s family), by the information one is able to obtain from the environment in which they find themselves, and by entrepreneurially-related experience (people become more alert based on starting things). Yu (2001, p.52) argues that self-competition, or “intertemporal completion between future and past selves stemming from the desire to test self-ability” is the most important consideration in enhancing alertness.</p>
			<p>Particular factors might make someone in poverty less entrepreneurial alert. While pure necessity can promote alertness, the presence of urgent or overwhelming problems (hunger, illness, emotional strain, violence) can so preoccupy the individual that they have less cognitive room to be alert.  Similarly, individuals may develop fairly fixed interpretation frameworks in order to ensure basic survival in a challenging poverty context. Information that derives from new events or novel developments is made to fit the person’s existing interpretation framework, and anything that disrupts or challenges this framework is ignored or viewed as a deviance or obstacle (Yu, 2001). Modifying one’s framework, interpreting things in different ways, and uncovering new ways of seeing how things fit together can seem quite risky. They may therefore have less motivation to search for information that disconfirms existing assumptions or the status quo.  Further, the nature of new informational inputs available to the poor could produce opportunities of such limited potential, or that require resources that seem so far beyond the reach of the individual, that they become less motivated over time to recognize new possibilities.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>

			<h4><b><u>The Entrepreneur’s Opportunity Horizon</u></b></h4>
			<p>Assuming some level of alertness, then, a related issue concerns the kinds of opportunities that are identified by those in poverty.  The poor launch ventures of all types, including high growth ventures, but they disproportionately start survival and lifestyle ventures.  Various factors account for this tendency, but a key one concerns the entrepreneur’s opportunity horizon, or the range of possibilities they are able to perceive. As Berkman (2015) notes, poverty restricts a person’s vision of what might be possible.</p>
			<p>When thinking about starting a business, we tend to consider the things we know.  The realm of possibilities tends to be limited to a) the needs we become familiar with in our daily lives as a mother, student, military veteran, victim,  shopper, person with a health ailment or disability, owner of a pet, hobbyist, and so forth; b) skills we possess and work experiences we have had; and c) things we directly observe in our surroundings, particularly our failry immediate environs.  While other factors may come into play, we are most influenced by that with which we are familiar. The person in poverty may be alert to opportunities, but the range of opportunities that he/she is able to recognize at any point in time is delimited by this horizon. Quite simply if a person has never been exposed to a computer, it is difficult for them to perceive opportunities related to computer equipment, software, networks, or services.</p>
			<p>This suggests that the environment, circumstances or context in which the individual is embedded can impose boundaries on their opportunity horizon. One’s context can limit the information content to which one is exposed while imposing rules and norms regarding how things are done, how one gets ahead, and what is appropriate. It provides information while serving as a lens through which information is processed.</p>
			<p>Opportunity horizons of the poor can be characterized in terms of two dimensions: breadth and depth. Breadth refers to the range of different opportunity arenas within which the entrepreneur is able to perceive or recognize possibilities.  While one may see opportunities in personal care, cleaning, transport, or construction, he or she may be unable to recognize opportunities related to genetic engineering of crops or design of underwater drones.  Depth concerns number of possibilities that are apparent within the specific opportunity arenas apparent to the entrepreneur. So within plumbing, one may see the opportunity to provide plumbing services to households who have a specific problem, but not perceive the need for selling plumbing service contracts that provide preventative maintenance and repair at a fixed annual rate. A nurse may see opportunities to build a business around home health care visits, but not see the possibility of providing patient assistance via telemedicine.</p>
			<p>The opportunity horizon for each individual is unique. Consider an individual living in a low-income neighborhood, with high unemployment rates and low earnings for individuals with low levels of education.  The neighborhood might be characterized by segregation, inequality, crime, gangs, violence, inadequate housing, lower quality schools, limited job opportunities, disorder, a lack of exposure to technology, and lots of families who struggle just to get by. The individual may have lived all his/her life in this kind of neighborhood, exposed to in-group socialization (i.e., establishing social ties and interacting with others from that same inner circle) (Harding, 2009). For many, moving out of such neighborhoods would seem to be a myth --- one study found that 70 percent of the families living in such high poverty neighborhoods in 1972 were found to still living in similar neighborhoods 40 years later (Sharkey, 2013). This sort of environment can limit the kinds of demographic, social, technological, competitive, regulatory or other developments of which one is aware or to which one is exposed. Thus, the opportunity horizon of such an individual is inevitably constrained, often to very small and short-lived pockets of disequilibrium in the marketplace.</p>
			<p>But opportunity horizons do not have to be static and predetermined. They can be flexible, dynamic and elastic. Opportunity horizons can be enhanced where the individual is exposed to new sources or types of information, influences, and experiences. For example, as a teenager from such a context pursues an internship out of the neighborhood, joins the military and travels abroad, takes on a hobby that leads them to pursue whole new sources of information and expertise, is able to attend college, engages in or expands their social network by connecting with people in different social and economic milieus, they can be stimulated by a different reality and their opportunity horizon expands. The social context is particularly important for expanding the individual’s opportunity horizon.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the institutional context matters. The culture, values, societal norms and attitudes of the neighborhood can serve to highlight opportunities in the informal economy, including technically illegal, anti-social or socially incongruent activities. Lack of support from formal institutions coupled with severe resource constraints can make the identification and exploitation of opportunities in the informal economy especially attractive.</p>
			<p>Figure 1 represents a conceptualization of the opportunity horizon for someone in poverty.  Here, three levels of stringencies expand or contract the opportunity horizon. At the core level, opportunity horizon in poverty can be expanded by exposure to new knowledge, information, education and observation of other realities. A second level factors include out-group socialization, peers and leaders, connections with different neighborhoods and communities, and role models. At a more macro level, institutional support, government support, empowering programs, and active civic participation are examples of strategies and devices to promote the expansion of opportunity horizons among the poor. It is at this third level where entrepreneurship intervention programs directed at the poor fit in.</p>

			<p>Alvarez and Barney (2014) provide a related argument regarding limits to the kinds of opportunities those in poverty are most likely to recognize.  They distinguish self-employment, discovery and creation opportunities. In essence, a self-employment opportunity involves replication of existing business concepts to fill some unmet demand. They are not scalable and have limited potential. Discovery opportunities are formed by exogenous shocks to an industry or market (e.g., significant regulatory, social or demographic change), where being early in seeing the potential of these developments and creating barriers to entry are critical for scalability and success. Creation opportunities find the entrepreneur actually initiating change in the environment that opens up new possibilities, generally by developing new knowledge or technology. New needs are created or needs that previously could not be addressed are now addressed.  The result is new behaviors and routines on the part of both the entrepreneur (and other members of the value chain) and the users. Those living in conditions of abject poverty will be more likely to recognize and exploit self-employment opportunities than discovery or creation opportunities. This likelihood is due to the lower levels of human, social and financial capital and more limited infrastructure necessary to support self-employment opportunities.  However, all three are possible when the challenges of the capital constraints and infrastructure can be overcome.</p>
