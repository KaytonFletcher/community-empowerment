			<h4><b><u>Introduction</b></u></h4>
			<p>We next focus on the low income individual and their preparation (P) for the entrepreneurial journey. Gaps and shortcomings in the individual’s background must be addressed as he/she learns to master the competencies related to entrepreneurial success. Thus, it is critical to prepare individuals in low-income conditions to become entrepreneurs, providing them with the knowledge, tactics and tools to think and act more entrepreneurially.</p>
			<p>The critical issue here is literacy, which can raises the productivity of individuals and those with whom they work, enable them to tap more of their creative potential, accelerate the acquisition and transmission of knowledge and useful information, encourage the pursuit of  vocational training and technical education, and heighten the impact of performance-based  economic incentives. Literacy also contributes to stimulating entrepreneurship. Higher levels of literacy increase the depth and breadth of the individual’s opportunity horizon, making it possible to recognize more and better business opportunities. It enables the development of more sophisticated business concepts and models, enhances resource gathering/leveraging and the access to different stakeholders, and open different possibilities for business growth. In short, literacy is required across all stages of the venture creation process.</p>
			<p>As illustrated in Figure 1, entrepreneurial success is dependent upon at least five literacies: functional, financial, economic, business, and technological.</p>
			<br></br>

			<br></br><br></br>

			<h5><b>a. Functional literacy</b></h5>
			<p>The abilities to read and write, use numbers, interpret images and graphs, understand and communicate effectively, gain and integrate knowledge, and solve mathematical problems come into play in every facet of business operations.  Consider basic reading and writing. Without rudimentary skills, how can we expect the low income entrepreneur to ever do the research and create a business plan?  Or, in everyday operations, imagine the entrepreneur who does not understand the terms in a written contract or lease, cannot write a proper business letter to a supplier, misinterprets a written request or complaint from a customer, misreads instructions on installing or operating a piece of equipment, or is unable to study books, manuals and reports on industry trends and company best practices.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the implications of one’s ability with numbers, which we have noted can be an even greater problem among the poor, are just as significant.  Here are just ten of the everyday ways in which numeracy affects entrepreneurial success:</p>
			<p>•Calculating the size of a market opportunity;</p>
			<p>•Determining the feasibility of launching the business;</p>
			<p>•Setting prices in a manner that covers costs and generates an acceptable margin;</p>
			<p>•Determining shipping volumes, inventory needs and procurement requirements;</p>
			<p>•Properly preparing an invoice or bid;</p>
			<p>•Paying employees and customers correct amounts;</p>
			<p>•Recording expenses and revenues and determining if any profit is being made;</p>
			<p>•Measuring employee performance and operational efficiencies;</p>
			<p>•Analyzing patterns in customer purchases, business expenditures, customer complaints, or the effectiveness of different promotional approaches;</p>
			<p>•Paying taxes in correct amounts on dates they are due.</p>
			<p>One of the greatest concerns with entrepreneurs having poor numeracy skills is not simply that they make miscalculations, but instead they will entirely avoid key activities that involve numbers.  This is an additional reason why it can cost the low income entrepreneur more to start and manage a venture.</p>
			<p>Poor functional literacy is also manifested in the ways the entrepreneur communicates with stakeholders. Lack of understanding of reading, writing and numeracy undermines self-confidence, making the low income entrepreneur less apt to ask questions or to interact in ways that might expose their perceived shortcomings. For the poor, communication efforts are also hindered by unfamiliarity with both the language of business and of the hidden rules of others who comes from middle or upper income backgrounds.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><b>b. Financial literacy</b></h5>
			<p>Financial literacy is concerned with the ability to make financially responsible decisions, and requires the learning of a language (e.g., asset versus liability, revenue versus profit, fixed versus variable cost). Weakness here is particularly acute among the poor. It begins with fundamentals such as knowing how to save, manage credit and debt obligations, and clearly separate business from personal financial transactions. It helps the entrepreneur determine how much money is needed to start the business and how long it will take to reach breakeven. Two especially critical literacy skills include budgeting and cash flow management. Living week to week on a tight budget is nothing new to a person in poverty, but creating, and then operating in accordance with, a budget that accurately anticipates business expenses, tax payments, and receipt of revenues, and allows for unpredictable developments, is a whole new challenge. Good budgeting practices will enable good financial planning. The entrepreneur can better anticipate cash needs in the months to come, or set aside enough money to enable equipment purchases or the hiring of employees.</p>
			<p>Cash flow is the difference between how much money comes into the business each day, and how much goes out.  The entrepreneur often has to spend money upfront to complete a job for a customer, and only gets paid afterwards. And it may take quite a few jobs before they are actually breaking even. Given small amounts of personal savings and an inability to raise much money, the financial strain can be intense, especially in the early days of the venture. Surviving can depend on one’s skills in knowing when to pay which bills, how much to pay, and how to stretch payables, together with discipline in making customers remit when payment is due. Poor cash flow management has also destroyed businesses that achieved decent levels of sales, and were growing rapidly, yet had no cash to pay for things. The money was all tied up in the things that make growth possible, such as inventory, expanded capacity, new employees, and additional equipment. A supplier, landlord or banker demands payment, the entrepreneur has no way to pay, and the company gets cut off and perhaps forced into bankruptcy. It is also worth noting that many ventures started by the poor are cash businesses, meaning they do not accept credit cards or other electronic and non-cash forms of payment. This can create more problems in terms of tracking what money comes in, when, and for what purpose, and also creates more opportunities for employee theft.</p>
			<p>A cash flow issue that gets some low income entrepreneurs into trouble involves the payment of various taxes on a monthly, quarterly and/or annual basis. Depending on the country and region or state in which the business is located, different taxes are due. Consider excise, sales or VAT taxes which are collected from customers. There can be a temptation to use this money to cover short-term cash needs. The financially literate entrepreneur will appreciate how dangerous this is, and why these and other taxes (e.g., estimated income taxes, workers compensation and payroll taxes if there are employees) must be paid on a timely basis or the company can be fined large amounts, foreclosed upon, or financially blacklisted.</p>
			<p>The poor are also subject to personal financial crises and unpredictable emergencies (e.g., a bill for critical medical services, interruptions of food stamps, eviction from an apartment or low income housing project). These kinds of developments have far greater implications for both business and personal cash flow than they would for a middle or upper income family. Timing is also a factor, as a reimbursement or payment may be due to a poor person, but will not be available when they actually need the money. As a result, the poor may be less resilient to disruptive financial events. Avoiding the tendency to turn to predatory lenders when these events occur is another benefit of financial literacy.</p>
			<p>Lastly, financial literacy affects the ability of the entrepreneur to read and properly interpret the financial statements of the firm.  These statements tell a story from which the entrepreneur can learn and make course corrections.  They convey the obligations and value of the firm.  They indicate whether money is being made and where, and if bills can be paid. They enable the identification of patterns in terms of sales and key expense categories, payables and receivables, and inventory turnover.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><b>c. Economic literacy</b></h5>
			<p>Entrepreneurs operate in markets. To function, they must appreciate how markets work and the implications of changes in economic conditions and public policies for business decisions. This is economic literacy, and it includes an ability to identify economic problems, understand economic incentives and disincentives, and weigh the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action.</p>
			<p>Economic literacy begins with an understanding of supply and demand, and how the combination of the two determine the entrepreneur’s position in the marketplace. The entrepreneur must has to recognize impending changes in supply (competitors and their actions) or demand (customers and their actions) conditions, and what they mean for the prices he/she should be charging, when to invest in equipment, how much to build inventory up or down, and when to expand or reduce staffing (including temporary and part-time staff), among other decisions. The entrepreneur must also incorporate into these decisions the implication of other economic variables, such as changes in interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates, trade barriers and tax policy/incentives.</p>
			<p>Another important dimension of economic literacy is cost-benefit analysis. Consider the start-up entrepreneur trying to decide whether to teach themselves to do their own bookkeeping or website maintenance, or if they should outsource these activities to another firm.  This is a resource allocation decision. The economically literate entrepreneur is able systematically evaluate all of the costs (e.g., financial, non-financial and opportunity costs) and benefits (e.g., savings, freeing up time, control) in arriving at a decision.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>

			<h5><b>d. Business (non-financial) literacy</b></h5>
			<p>Business itself has a language together with a required skill set that encompasses the basics of administration and record-keeping, organizing (e.g., tasks, inventory), selling, hiring, and a wide variety of other tasks. Beyond difficulties in learning these tasks, the low income entrepreneur who is business illiterate can struggle when interacting with potential stakeholders.  Consider some of the terms a supplier, investor or distributor is likely to use in everyday conversation. Examples include: inventory turnover, barriers to entry, differentiation, segmentation and targeting, product positioning, brand equity, customer acquisition cost, broker, early adopter, experience curve, price elasticity, penetration pricing, slotting allowances, exclusive distribution, present value, switching costs and order cycle time. The emergence of the discipline of entrepreneurship has led to the popularizing of a number of additional terms. For instance, terms like business model, angel investor, elevator pitch, cash burn rate, minimum viable product, scalable venture, lean start-up, bootstrapping, buy-sell agreement, exit strategy are now commonplace. Lack of understanding of such terms can also mean the ideas behind them are not being incorporated into business decisions.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><b>e. Technological literacy</b></h5>
			<p>Technological literacy includes an awareness and appreciation for the significance of key technologies impacting a business, the ability to use these technologies, and an understanding of the issues raised by their use. It prepares individuals to interact and function more effectively in what is increasingly a technological world---a world where technology is re-defining all aspects of life and virtually everything a business does. More than just information or digital technology, it includes a range of other technological arenas (e.g., nano, energy, chemical, laser, robotic, etc.) that can play a role in the performance of a particular business.</p>
			<p>For entrepreneurs, technology literacy is relevant for developing the products or services that they sell, and for enabling many of the operational processes within the business (e.g., production, procurement, logistics, bookkeeping, human resource management, marketing).  Of our five literacies, it is arguably the most dynamic--- requiring continuous learning to keep abreast of new developments that occur almost daily. As such, it is an area where, even when the low income entrepreneur develops an adequate level of literacy, they can quickly fall behind.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Literacies, Venture Creation and the Poor</b></u></h4>
			<p>Levels of literacy in these five areas vary considerably for people in all income groups.  Among the poor, there are many who demonstrate high levels of literacy in some if not all of these five areas.  As a group, however, those in poverty are disproportionately represented at the lower end of the spectrum for each type of literacy. These low levels can be especially problematic when a poor person attempts to launch a business.  Table 1 summarizes key obstacles in venture creation as they relate to each of our five literacies.</p>
			<p>Importantly, these obstacles significantly impact the low income entrepreneur at every stage of the entrepreneurial process.   Let us briefly consider each of these stages.</p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yRxneRV.png" class="centerimg" height="900" width="700">
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Opportunity recognition: </i></h5>
			<p>Opportunities (unmet needs, gaps in the marketplace) exist in the environments that surround us, but the challenge is to recognize them as they emerge. Of our five literacies, functional and technological literacy play paramount roles in determining the kinds of opportunities recognized by the poor. If one struggles to read, is not adept on use of computers and online search engines, and does not understand the potential applications of a given technology, one’s opportunity horizon is severely constrained.  Poor and minority families are less likely to have access to a computer and the Internet in their homes and less likely to have the necessary skills and knowledge to use these resources. Further, they can struggle to assess the legitimacy of a given information source or the reliability of the information. Not surprisingly, then, the poor rely more heavily on information obtained through personal networks compared to other sources. For these reasons, low income entrepreneurs are more likely to uncover opportunities that are readily observable in their immediate surroundings and less likely to find opportunities involving discovery and creation.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Business concept and model development: </i></h5>
			<p>Literacy is a key contributor to kinds of business ideas conceived, and the nature of the ventures created, by the poor. Especially relevant here are functional, technological and financial literacies and their respective abilities to contribute to innovative business ideas and novel business models.  Less functional literacy leads to simpler business ideas, and more informal sector ventures. All too often the ventures of the poor are survival or lifestyle ventures that are effectively selling a ‘commodity’ (e.g., cleaning, transport, hair care) that is not well-differentiated, and operate in highly competitive markets. As a result, they find themselves competing on the basis of low price. Improved financial literacy would enable the poor to more accurately estimate profit potential and better appreciate the underlying logic of how profits can be made for a given venture concept. It can help estimate the potential of different market segments, and hence where to focus one’s limited resources. Improved technological literacy could allow these entrepreneurs to conceptualize ventures with enhanced capabilities and/or the potential to create new sources of value, as well as ventures that reach broader markets and are more scalable. Familiarity with technology can also lead to ventures with lower costs and reduced labor intensity.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Assessing the needed resources: </i></h5>
			<p>What are the minimal resources needed to start a venture?  While not always the most critical resource, money can be the most problematic for low income entrepreneurs. They will be unfamiliar with the various sources of money and their requirements based on underdeveloped business literacy. Moreover, the combination of poverty and low financial literacy finds the entrepreneur underestimating how much is needed, and underinvesting in key areas (e.g., basic equipment and facilities).  The roles of suppliers, distributors, public authorities and other stakeholders as resource providers will not be understood based on limited business literacy.  Decisions on the trade-offs between working from home and having premises, or between buying a truck and spending more on staff are more difficult based on low economic literacy.  Recognition of the importance of intellectual property in the business as a source of advantage and differentiation (and means to higher margins and more growth) is most affected by technological literacy together with business literacy. As a generalization, the ventures of the poor reflect a greater focus on financial and physical resources and less emphasis on intellectual property.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Acquiring the necessary resources: </i></h5>
			<p>When it comes to raising money, the poor typically do not have access to conventional bank debt or to equity investors at the launch stage. Financial literacy is the key here, particularly in terms of supporting good savings habits, building a good credit rating, establishing some kind of asset base, and finding sources of collateral. Combined with functional literacy, it also affects the ability of the entrepreneur to put together key financial performance data on the proposed venture and communicate this information to bankers or investors (or put together a crowd funding campaign). The business plan plays a key role here, and its quality is undermined by weak functional, financial and business literacies. The poor must rely more heavily on bootstrapping, leveraging, and guerrilla tactics to overcome resource constraints. Even here literacy makes all the difference, especially given the limited social and business networks of many of those in poverty. Financial literacy can contribute to bootstrapping efforts in such areas as extending payables and shortening receivables. Similarly, the communication and creativity skills involved in leveraging relationships with suppliers to get extended payment terms, getting retailers to hold more inventory, or getting customers to pay in advance of service delivery all require strong functional and business literacy.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Implementation and adaptation: </i></h5>
			<p>A successful launch requires knowledge of an increasingly complex regulatory environment. This can include licensing, certification, and inspection requirements, as well as compliance with labor, zoning, taxation and other laws. The entrepreneur is usually executing a number of contracts. Mistakes here are traceable to low functional, business and economic literacy.  Once in business, one must be able to simultaneously produce, sell, buy inventory, maintain facilities, keep records, deal with customer problems, and so forth. Business, financial and technological literacies become essential. For many poor entrepreneurs, the business is initially launched part-time or in the evenings and weekends, as they continue to work full- and part-time jobs to survive. This can give them some time to learn (which includes further developing literacies).  The ongoing abilities to learn and adapt will distinguish the successful venture from the failure, and while facilitated by all the literacies, they both center on functional literacy.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Management and growth: </i></h5>
			<p>The entrepreneurial skills required to overcome obstacles and get a venture launched must now be supplemented by good management skills. Functional and business literacies can contribute to the entrepreneur’s ability to organize, plan, prioritize and delegate. With poor entrepreneurs, the kinds of resources on which the initial business is built (i.e., reliance on handcraft or manual labor) can result in a highly labor intensive operation, which takes time away from planning and organizing. Critical managerial activities do not receive adequate attention. Beyond this, lack of (particularly functional) literacy can undermine the entrepreneur’s confidence, making them more cautious towards and fearful of growth and what it could bring in terms of demands and risks. Another key factor in growth is technological literacy, as investment in process and product technologies, together with development of intellectual property, are instrumental is growing or scaling a company. The poor frequently do not have the kind of literacy that enables the understanding, application and use of various technologies and advanced equipment.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i>Exit/harvest: </i></h5>
			<p>When it comes to exit strategies, the poor most often simply shut the business down and sell off any assets, pass the business to an heir or acquaintance, or arrange for some party to purchase the business.  Optimizing the harvest of a venture requires planning, which builds on most of the literacies.  The entrepreneur must be prepared in terms of his/her personal financial position, suggesting the importance of financial literacy.  Financial, business and economic literacies are necessary for estimating the value of the business and negotiating terms of a sale or acquisition.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Improving Literacy among the Poor</u></b></h4>
			<p>The conclusion from this discussion is that limited functional literacy seriously detracts from every stage in the entrepreneurial process, and the other four literacies play a part that is more or less prominent depending on the stage. Importantly, these literacies are not independent. For instance, functional literacy makes possible the other four.  Financial and business literacies can contribute to economic literacy. And technological literacy interacts with business literacy to impact venture development.</p>
			<p>Adult literacy, and particularly the functional, financial and technological areas, has received growing attention in developed economies over the past few decades. Adult literacy programs help individuals get the basic skills they need in reading, writing, doing math, language proficiency, and problem-solving. The programs tend to be quite diverse, utilizing a variety of pedagogical approaches.  They also struggle with high drop-out rates, while sustainable funding continues to be a major obstacle.</p>
			<p>Low income adults can encounter distinct difficulties when it comes to learning. Scholarly research with adult literacy and numeracy learners has highlighted how the social, economic and physical conditions of poverty impact the ability to grasp and retain content and maintain engagement in the learning process (e.g., Barton et al. 2007). Engagement and persistence of learners can be positively affected by pedagogical practices that promote social interactions and co-learning practices (e.g., working in pairs or small groups, providing instant feedback, reciprocal teaching and encouraging fluent, oral reading). Where educators and staff help individual learners establish goals, reinforce learner persistence, and focus efforts on development of self-efficacy, there is a positive impact on adult engagement and learning outcomes (Comings, 2009). Effective programs are able to approach literacy in the larger social context of basic learning needs and opportunities, where learning is strengthened and amplified by a network of opportunities for diverse and continuing education, and a network of actors (e.g., lecturers, mentors, coaches and fellow learners). Balanced emphasis is placed on both the formal and the informal educational settings.  Appropriately designed literacy programs can enable vulnerable adults to change their dispositions to learning, achieve their personal goals, and transition towards futures that they aspire, including entrepreneurship (Maclachlan, & Tett, 2010).</p>
			<p>However, the sad irony is that those who most need access to literacy programs are often the ones most deprived of this access. Availability of programs varies by locality, online programs require computer and internet access, scheduling may not be at appropriate or flexible times, and awareness is affected by how heavily promoted programs are through channels reaching the poor. Further, those with the greatest need often require assistance with transportation, paying for educational materials, meals, and daycare for their children.  The end result finds the illiteracy cycle is entangled with the poverty cycle, with literacy a common outcome from poverty, and the poverty conditions a barrier to engaging in literacy programs.</p>
			<p>Yet, when the poor enroll in literacy programs, the returns are evident: higher individual earnings (Psacharopoulos & Patrinos, 2004), reduced crime (Lochner & Moretti, 2004), improved health of children (Currie and Moretti, 2003), improved civic participation (Dee, 2004), enhanced work possibilities (Moretti, 2004) and labor productivity (Coulombe & Tremblay, 2006). Schaffer and Mohs (2016) demonstrate how financial literacy programs aimed at low-income adults can have a positive ripple effect on family financial stability.</p>
			<p>The two great challenges in literacy are, first, to better prepare the poor for the twenty-first century, which means preparing them for the age of entrepreneurship; and second, to reduce the disparities in literacy outcomes between those from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds. With the latter point, if anything, the gaps in our five literacies between the poor and rest of society continue to grow.</p>
			<p>As we move forward, increasing the number of poor people in adult literacy programs, and continuing to improve the design and delivery of these programs, are important steps.  However, for those in poverty who strive to be entrepreneurs, the need is more complex.  Extant literacy programs target the general public, including those in poverty. They emphasize functional literacy.  Alternatively, training and development programs for entrepreneurs tend to stress financial and business literacy and sometimes technological literacy, with less emphasis on functional and economic literacy.  The ongoing need is for an integrated approach for developing low income entrepreneurs that reflects the interplay among these literacies, where their interactions are reinforced as the entrepreneurial journey unfolds.</p>
			<p>Finally, the multiple literacies of entrepreneurship involve a continuum of learning. The rhythm and intensity of advances in the different literacies of entrepreneurship require that learning be ongoing and immersive.  For many of those starting ventures, technology literacy would appear to be the area where they would most quickly fall behind. However, the sheer pace of information provision and new knowledge generation is accelerating, affecting all five literacies. Meanwhile, as this information becomes more complex, the challenges of processing and assimilating it will become even greater. This further reinforces the vital importance of continuing educational opportunities for low income entrepreneurs.</p>
