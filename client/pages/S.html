			<h4><b><u>[S] SUPPORTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE</b></u></h4>
			<p>In entrepreneurship, supportive infrastructure refers to the complete range of community-based resources needed to sustain a venture from launch to exit. We can divide these into <b>general</b> and <b>entrepreneurship-specific</b> elements.  General infrastructure includes facilities and buildings where businesses can operate, including factories, a headquarters, retail locations, warehouses, and office space. These buildings and edifices need power and energy, water and security systems every day, and police and fire services in case of emergency. Infrastructure also includes roads, bridges, viaducts, parking spots and public transportation services that allow for distribution, moving products from point A to B and to get customers to the business. Creating and managing a business daily further requires broadband access, as well as information and communication technologies such as internet, phone and fax. Additional elements of a supportive infrastructure include access to quality educational and training institutions, which are critical for the five literacies of entrepreneurship, and to financial institutions, such as banks and credit institutions, where the entrepreneur can manage the daily financial operations of the business and have access to capital. These general elements are vitally important for the daily operations of a venture, but they are not enough.</p>
			<p>Entrepreneurial ventures also benefit from a more specialized infrastructure that has come to be called an “entrepreneurial ecosystem.”  It is defined as the agglomeration of interrelated individuals, institutions, organizations, and regulatory entities in a particular geographic area that act upon and promote entrepreneurial initiatives and actions. Like a biological ecosystem, an entrepreneurial ecosystem includes highly interdependent components that interact with the larger environment to enable ventures to start, grow and exit. We typically consider entrepreneurial ecosystems at a community level, although the concept is also relevant at regional and national levels, and there are interdependencies among elements at these different levels.</p>
			<p>Focusing on the local community, a number of institutional structures play a role, including chambers of commerce, local economic development agencies, small business development centers, nonprofits involved in various entrepreneurial support activities.  The availability of incubators and accelerators, as well as access to facilities such as fab labs, makerspaces or other facilities where prototypes and products can be developed, is important. Entrepreneurs also need elements that help them build social capital such as concept pitch and business plan competitions, mentoring and apprenticeship programs and social forums especially dedicated for the entrepreneurial community. Here, entrepreneurs can develop their business ideas and plans, get feedback and counseling from experts, access resources and establish partnerships. When it comes to money to support the venture, infrastructure components include micro-credit programs, grants, venture capital and angel investors. Universities and colleges contribute to the ecosystem through research, inventions, and trained student talent, as well as academic entrepreneurship programs. Another key element is the local small business community, which provides networking and mentoring opportunities, as well as the potential for collaboration with new start-ups. Finally, the broad scope of professional service providers in such areas as legal, accounting, marketing, design and branding contribute to the ecosystem. Figure 1 presents an overview of the general as well as the entrepreneurship-specific components of an effective infrastructure.</p>

			<p>Low-income neighborhoods generally have under-developed infrastructures (both general and entrepreneurship-specific) and often lack fundamental infrastructure components. A major force shaping many low-income neighborhoods has been the transformation of the urban economy.  For the past fifty years and especially in the past two decades, urban economies have become more decentralized, global, and heavily reliant on finance, services, and technology rather than on the once larger and more powerful manufacturing base. This has affected basic infrastructure investments in low-income neighborhoods, where the poor have to deal with deficient roads and parking facilities, insufficient public transportation options, frequent power outages, deficits in sewers and drains, reduced access to internet or the phone, low security and policy surveillance.</p>
			<p>The poor can encounter other differences in the available infrastructure, as payday loan issuers often replace banks; dollar stores replace grocery and office supply stores; government-assistance programs replace private sector investment. Furthermore, neighborhood effects, or the coupling of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with other social problems, such as high rates of unemployment, crime, or adolescent delinquency – play an important (often-detrimental) role in ongoing infrastructure development. Major financial institutions avoid opening branches in poor neighborhoods, as they fear robberies or vandalism, as well as low deposits or levels of capital to work with. And other entrepreneurship-specific infrastructure elements, such as incubators and accelerators are missing entirely, preferring to locate in areas with easy transportation access, good parking, central to conferences centers and universities, and proximate to the creative community.</p>

			<h4><u>General Infrastructure: Challenges for the Poor Entrepreneur</u></h4>
			<p>While most of the general or basic infrastructure components are taken for granted by those who live in middle or higher-income neighborhoods, the poor struggle to deal with infrastructure deficits on a daily basis. These deficits have significant implications for the ability of low-income entrepreneurs to create and grow ventures (see Figure 2).</p>

			<h4><u>Entrepreneurship-specific Infrastructure: Do Ecosystems Serve the Poor?</u></h4>
			<p>If we consider the components of entrepreneurial ecosystems, cities and regions across the globe are witnessing increases in both number and quality of these components, as well as in the interconnectedness among them.  Incubators and accelerators are appearing that specialize in everything from biotech start-ups to food and restaurant concepts. New forms of angel networks and microcredit schemes are being developed.  Service providers (e.g., law firms, consultants, web- and app-development companies) are focusing on the unique needs of different kinds of start-ups and early stage firms.  Universities are getting engaged with local ecosystems in a variety of ways. And, while components of these ecosystems often operate as silos, with relatively weak coordination among the components as the biggest shortcoming in most ecosystems, we are seeing progress here as well.  The different players are learning how to better communicate, collaborate, eliminate duplication of effort, reinforce one another, and collectively contribute to the fostering of ventures at different stages in the start-up and development process.</p>
			<p>Components of these ecosystems can enable the entrepreneur at every stage of the venture development process (see Table 1). In the ideation stage, participating in local pitch competitions, experimenting in a fablab, talking with a mentor from the small business community, or participating in a training program sponsored by a small business development center can help identify flaws and ways to adapt the business idea. When in the pre-start-up stage, business plan competitions, incubators, microcredit programs fablabs, universities, mentors and professional service providers can help with development of plans, prototypes, seed funding, business registration, and other preparatory activities for a launch. With actual startup, the entrepreneur can benefit from community social forums, microcredit programs, small business development centers, local small businesses, and municipal government for everything from shared facilities and equipment, to help with marketing and sales, to assistance with getting government contracts and regulatory compliance. As the entrepreneur makes adjustments and the business stabilizes, he/she leans on professional service providers (legal, accounting services), mentors (advice), local government (contracts, tax abatements), chambers (contacts), other small businesses (shared resources, contacts) and banks (loans). If real growth happens, universities provide employees, angels and other equity investors provide capital, and government bodies provide economic incentives. Even in the exit stage, professional service providers, government agencies, and locally-based potential acquirers can facilitate the harvest of the business.</p>

			<p>For the most part, the poor have been left out of entrepreneurial ecosystems.  There are a number of possible reasons for this exclusion.  The biggest factor is the kinds of businesses they want to pursue (survival and lifestyle ventures).  Beyond this, the limitations of their social networks are such that the poor are often not connected directly or even indirectly to key individuals within the ecosystem. They often work one or more jobs during hours that components of the ecosystem are accessible, while also being reliant on public transit. Literacy shortcomings affect interactions with members of the ecosystem. Problems here include not understanding the nature of one’s needs for a venture, who to communicate with for a particular need, what to ask for, and how to request and obtain resources (including information) that could address these needs.</p>
			<p>However, the problem is often more fundamental.  Elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem are simply not set up to serve the poor, and they make little effort to reach out to those in poverty. The knowledge and experiences of the people within the ecosystem, the nature of the services and assistance they offer, and even more basic things like the kinds of speakers they feature at forums, do not reflect an appreciation for the poverty condition and its implications for entrepreneurial action.  This reality is not necessarily intentional or reflective of a lack of concern for the poor.  It is more often due to the objectives, sources of funding, time horizons, and backgrounds of the people running the organizations that constitute the ecosystem. They are set up to foster high growth ventures that commercial new technology, will create lots of jobs, bring visibility to a community, and attract creative people and other companies to the region. Ironically, these kinds of ventures represent a very small percentage of start-ups. The ventures of the poor do not qualify for most incubators or accelerators, are uninteresting to angel networks, have little chance of winning business plan or pitch competitions, and do not require the services of specialized law firms or tax consultants.</p>
			<p>However, there are a growing number of exceptions to this overall pattern. Let us consider just a few of these. Within the U.S., the South Side Innovation Center in Syracuse, New York is a university-supported facility serving low income start-ups in a distressed part of the city with space, training, microcredit and product testing capabilities. A non-profit food incubator in California called La Cocina houses up to twelve businesses per year that are owned by low-income and immigrant women. La Cocina cultivates low-income food entrepreneurs as they formalize and grow their businesses by providing affordable commercial kitchen space, industry-specific technical assistance and access to market opportunities. Another example is Hot Bread Kitchen in East Harlem, New York that requires membership to include thirty percent low-income entrepreneurs and will subsidize their use of the incubator's resources. It offers the usual kitchen space and storage but also hosts monthly workshops and one-on-one business advising. Many examples exist in other developed economies as well.  For instance, in Portugal, AmadoraEmpreende is a municipal incubation program that serves beneficiaries of social support and those residing in degraded or resettled neighborhoods, while FabLab Lisboa refurbished an abandoned slaughterhouse in a decaying inner-city neighborhood to create a facility that enables low income entrepreneurs to work on prototypes.  Malaga, Spain has created Promálaga Urban Incubators, which is designed for to foster retail ventures in newly created neighborhoods, where the social and economic fabric does not exist yet.</p>
			<p>Other initiatives offer training, mentoring, development and connections.  The CHARO Community Development Corp. provides career and business assistance to help generate economic development in low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles County; and the Bronx Business Bridge is part of NYCEDC's Low Income Fast Track Entrepreneurship Program (LIFT), designed to connect New Yorkers from low-income neighborhoods with opportunities to grow their business. Some chambers of commerce have adjusted their target demographic. For example, minority chambers of commerce in a number of cities focus efforts on supporting entrepreneurship among underserved population groups. The Service Corp of Retired Executives (SCORE), supported by the U.S. Small Business Administration, is a large network of business experts that provide free business mentoring through over 300 chapters across the country. Small Business Development Centers are also located in communities throughout the U.S. and offer no-cost counselling for existing small business owners, including the poor. </p>
			<p>There are also positive signs with regard to university engagement with low income entrepreneurs.  Rutgers University has launched the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship & Economic Development, a multifaceted initiative that includes technology training, incubation, assistance in pursing government and private funding, and other resources to the economically and socially disadvantaged in Newark, New Jersey. The University of Florida coordinates the Gainesville Entrepreneurship & Adversity Program (GEAP), an integrated six-part program involving faculty, graduate students, and community partners with a goal of empowering those living in adverse circumstances to create and grow their own businesses. Princeton University is pursuing a similar program in Trenton, New Jersey.</p>
			<p>In the financing arena, local governments, nonprofit organizations and community banks are creating novel types of microcredit programs to provide low-interest loans and grants to poor entrepreneurs. Developments here are explored in Chapter Nine. In addition, local governments, universities and larger private companies are supporting the ventures of minorities, women and the disabled with efforts to award contracts for a wide range of products and services. Some of the more proactive efforts give training and assistance to low income entrepreneurs on how to win contracts, and include them in mentor-protégé programs where they work with companies that have won contracts in the past.</p>
			<p>While promising, these examples tend to be isolated programs. They are not always well-embedded into low-income neighborhoods, reflecting unique historical, cultural, political and demographic characteristics and associated needs of particular poor communities. Just as critically, they are rarely well-integrated into the larger entrepreneurial ecosystem of the city or region.  Doing so would find many players in the ecosystem identifying ways their services might be adapted to reflect unique needs of the poor. It would also find connections among elements of the ecosystem that could help the low income entrepreneur through different stages and problems in the entrepreneurial process.  Finally, it would extend the ecosystem to include new components, such as programs that address the five literacies discussed in Chapter Six, or ones that can help with the transport and daycare needs of the person in poverty. The alternative would be to develop dedicated entrepreneurial ecosystems just with the low income community, which could be prohibitively expensive.</p>

			<h4><u>Overcoming the Infrastructure Divide</u></h4>
			<p>Infrastructure must be the beginning point in any effort to make entrepreneurship a viable pathway out of poverty.  The basic infrastructure provides a foundation for building a company, while the entrepreneurial ecosystem facilitates the venture creation process.  The foundation enables literacy, efficient transportation, space to conduct operations and an ability to conduct them in relative safety, financial transactions, utilities to fuel operations, and access to the world through broadband, information and communication technologies. And, as we have seen, the entrepreneurial ecosystem facilitates every stage in the entrepreneurial process.</p>
			<p>Low-income neighborhoods have inadequate infrastructures, while those in poverty rarely benefit from whatever entrepreneurial ecosystem exist within the larger community or region. These are principal reasons why they disproportionately create survival ventures and marginal lifestyle ventures that fall into the commodity trap, with unsustainable profit models. To change this state of affairs a more holistic approach is needed for fostering entrepreneurship among the poor.</p>
			<p>Holism implies approaches that are both comprehensive in the needs they consider and integrative in reflecting the ways needs affect and are affected by one another. It means solutions that simultaneously consider foundational and venture facilitating needs.  It can be problematic for people to grasp key business concepts in a startup training program if attendees have fundamental literacy problems.  Affordable space is less valuable if utilities are undependable or too costly, or one is not also addressing issues of broadband access and proximity to customers.  Offering mentors or access to incubators may be unwise if one does not also take into account the need for transportation, daycare and access at times when the poor entrepreneur must be at work. Microcredit and other forms of financial assistance must be tied to developing financial and business literacies.  And all of these efforts must be designed in ways that reflect the unique context and experiences of those in poverty. Alternatively, much can be invested with little result in terms of sustainable enterprises.</p>
