			<h4><b><u>Introduction</b></u></h4>
			<p>Finding the necessary financial resources is typically emphasized as the single biggest obstacle to starting a business. This not need be the case, as there are many available approaches to leveraging resources (see the end of this section), and non-financial factors also derail the launch of new ventures. Further, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) estimates that more than 25% of new ventures start with $500 or less. However, money certainly matters. The vast majority of startups struggle to get the needed financing, but financing is even more challenging for those in poverty. Given the daily struggle to address basic needs, allocating money to a venture is especially difficult.</p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Traditional Sources of Money</b></u></h4>
			<p>Four traditional sources of money are relied upon when starting a new business:  a) personal savings; b) bootstrapping from friends and family (informal capital); c) formal debt, where money is borrowed via bank loans, bank overdrafts, leasing and invoice discounting (formal capital); and d) equity, where investment is raised either by taking on a partner who has money, or selling shares in the business to private investors (sometimes called angels) who will make a return through dividends and future sale of their shares at an increased valuation. For the poor, there are serious issues surrounding each of these sources, which explains why they put less money into the venture at start-up, which limits their abilities to grow and succeed. </p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>a) Personal savings and personal credit cards </b></i></h5>
			<p>Personal savings is typically the first and far away the most prominent source of new venture finance. It can include the regular savings that one has accumulated by setting money aside, funds from an inheritance or sale of some asset (e.g., a home or vehicle), as well as money generated by cashing in retirement accounts (e.g., an IRA or 401(k) in the United States) or insurance policies. For founders, using their own savings is a means of maintaining control over the venture and avoiding the burden of debt repayment. Alternatively, it demonstrates to lenders and investors their commitment to the venture (that they have so-called “skin in the game”). For the poor, relying on personal savings may be their only option. </p>
			<p>Saving rates in the United States have historically been about 8 percent, but recent years have seen an average closer to 3 percent.  If we consider the poor, the picture is bleaker. Just under three-fourths (73%) of the lowest income adults in the U.S. (those with $24,999 or less earnings per year) have less than $1,000 in savings (GoBankingRates, 2016). </p>
			<p>Founders also use personal credit cards as a source of funding, and over the past two decades low-income families have been issued a greater volume of cards as more credit was extended to riskier customers. Yet, this is an expensive option, as credit card interest is high, and can be even higher on the cards held by the poor. Further, they can spend disproportionately more over time because of a tendency to pay only the minimum required amount each month. Not surprisingly, they are among the most profitable customers for the credit card industry. Low income families are aware of the risks in assuming too many credit products (inability to pay, harm to their credit rating) but they often assume these risks.  They can also demonstrate a cognitive bias (of which they are aware) where a stronger weight is given to payoffs closer to the present moment compared to a bigger required expenditure at some future time (O'Donoghue, &, Rabin, 1999).  As a result, the poor frequently enroll in different credit programs – sometimes using a high interest credit card to pay previous debts, or paying the required monthly amount on one credit card using another credit card, generating a vicious cycle of increasing debt. When such behavior is relied upon to pay the expenses of running a business, especially on an ongoing basis, the seeds are sown for business failure. In addition, many poor income entrepreneurs fail to completely separate their personal from their business finances, especially in the early days of the venture. Ultimately, then, unwise use of a credit card in either the personal or business domains will likely have an adverse effect on the business. </p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>b) Family and friends</b></i></h5>
			<p>Having exhausted individual savings as a source of funding, entrepreneurs are forced to turn to their extended family and personal friends. Money from family and friends is most typically structured as debt, often with an open-ended repayment date. These individuals normally settle for lower returns than formal investors, and sometimes no returns, as they are motivated by the personal relationship with the entrepreneur and a desire to see him or her succeed. They generally have little understanding of business. The risks to the entrepreneur of this kind of funding are also lower, although the failure to repay this money can damage family relationships and end friendships. For the poor entrepreneur, family and friends are an important yet very limited source of money. Karlan, Ratan and Zinman (2014) highlight how social ties and norms among the poor can promote bargaining and sharing within- and across-households, especially given their lack of access and distrust of financial institutions. The bigger challenge for the poor is that their family and friends may not have money to give, as they typically are also in a low-income condition and struggle with the same economic realities: limited cash flow for daily expenses and reduced or no savings.  Further, awareness that the entrepreneur is poor coupled with the perception that business failure rates are high can result in a low sense that the family member or friend will get their money back is low. </p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>c) Debt financing from banks</b></i></h5>
			<p>Bank loans are a vital source of financing for small businesses. The bank does not take an ownership interest in the business, but requires the amount of the loan to be repaid over a defined time period and charges interest at a variable or fixed rate. Unlike private investors, however, banks are not in the business of taking risks or making big returns.  Their key concern is getting the money back and earning an amount of interest that reflects the cost of money in real terms. As a result, they require collateral in the form of the entrepreneur’s business and personal assets, an established credit history and high credit score, clear evidence that the business will continue to perform well enough to repay the loan, personal guarantees from everyone with an ownership stake, and sometimes a co-signer to guarantee the loan. All of this means it is harder to get bank loans for a start-up, and easier once the business is up and running and has a proven cash flow. It is especially hard for the poor. </p>
			<p>Banks offer a variety of products to entrepreneurs, but the three most common are conventional small business loans, lines of credit, and business credit cards. With small business loans, the term of the loan will vary from three to seven years, the amount of the loan can range from $15,000 to over $1 million (but are typically over $100,000), and the interest rate will chiefly depend on the loan size (higher for smaller loans), loan term (higher for shorter terms), type of business, nature of any collateral, and the entrepreneur’s credit score/history. A line of credit is a type of short-term financing that gives the business owner access to a preapproved amount of money which they can use as they need it. Interest is paid only on the amount used and more can be borrowed as the principal is paid down. It is helpful for businesses that have cash needs that are seasonal or cyclical (e.g., a toy manufacturer may see a lot more money coming in around Christmas, while it is spending a lot more on production and inventory in earlier months), or to cover short terms expenses such as meeting payroll. In effect it helps to even out cash flow over the months of the year. A business credit card is a form of unsecured borrowing provided by banks. Shane (2008) reports that small businesses have up to $35,000 in balances on company credit cards, while Scott (2009) indicates nearly 60 percent of new businesses use them to fund up to a third of their debt in the first year. They are relative easy to obtain, but more expensive than loans or lines of credit. </p>
			<p>Governments also work with financial institutions in providing guarantees for small business loans. This enables a bank to make loans to someone who would otherwise not qualify, and offer a competitive interest rate. In the U.S., the Small Business Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, offers a number of loan guarantee programs to support new and emerging start-ups. For instance, the 7(a) program supports loans up to $5 million through banks and credit unions, while the Microloan Program supports amounts up to $50,000 through approved nonprofit lenders who also provide business training.  The latter is focused on women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs.  The 7(a) program has had a positive impact on economic performance in low-income markets. Further, the SBA’s 8A program helps socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs get government contracts, financial assistance, mentoring and other forms of support. Many individual states and cities in the U.S. also manage their own small business loan funds, although they vary in the extent to which someone in poverty would qualify. </p>
			<p>Despite the growth in these government-sponsored programs, it can still be quite difficult for a person in poverty to qualify for financial assistance. Bankers do not generally develop innovative products that reflect the unique needs and ability to pay of the poor. All too often, they court low-income customers with products that have high fees, even where lower cost solution are available from other providers. Barth, et al. (2008) provide evidence of considerable loan bias (a disproportionately low percentage of the total amount of loans) in low income communities. Those with low income are, for the most part, financially excluded.  In 2015, 7 percent (approximately 9.0 million) of U.S. households were unbanked, meaning no one in the household had a checking or savings account, and an additional 19.9 percent (24.5 million) were underbanked, where in spite of having a checking or savings account they were forced to obtain financial products outside of the banking system (Burhouse, et al., 2016). In low-income areas, such as South Bronx, more than half of the residents have no bank account, as banks are often more expensive than check cashers or other services (Servon, 2013). Some of this has contributed to the emergence of payday lenders, check-cashing services, and other fringe credit players who provide financial services to the poor at exorbitant costs. </p>
			<p>At least five major barriers keep the poor from fully accessing mainstream banking services: </p>
			<p>• <i>Profitability</i> – mainstream banks are profit-oriented, but they earn much lower returns from the smaller loans needed by the poor;</p>
			<p>• <i>Discrimination and redlining</i> – in some instances banks have denied loans to creditworthy individuals due to their race and offered less attractive products to minorities. Redlining refers to the practice of rejecting services or raising prices to residents of certain neighborhoods characterized by poverty or race;</p>
			<p>• <i>Formality and paperwork</i> – banks require extensive documentation to open an account or provide particular products, and poor people and minorities may have trouble with compliance based on educational and literacy shortcomings.  </p>
			<p>• <i>Democratization of credit</i> – availability of new forms of credit, and particularly the payday lending industry, that can worsen the debt position of the poor. They are marketed aggressively and can be easier to work with in terms of paperwork and documentation, making their very high cost products appealing to those with limited options;</p>
			<p>• <i>Financial knowledge</i> – Limited knowledge of and experience with the banking system on the part of the poor leaves them more suspicious and less trusting of financial institutions, while also limiting their awareness of options and understanding of the nature and implications of different financial products.</p>
			<p>A growing body of research supports the significance of these barriers. Bates and Robb (2013) find that business owners from minority neighborhoods experience higher costs when they borrow, receive smaller loans, and have their loan applications rejected more often. Blanchflower, Levin and Zimmerman (2003) demonstrate that black-owned small businesses were twice as likely to be denied credit even after controlling for differences in creditworthiness and other factors. Blanchard, Zhao and Zimmer (2005) also provide evidence of discrimination in loan approvals and suggest some of this might be traceable to lender stereotypes regarding the ability of businesses owned by the poor to succeed.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>

			<h5><i><b>d) Equity Investors</b></i></h5>
			<p>When establishing a new business, the sale of equity (shares) to external investors, is a typical source of funding. The investors can be individuals or companies, and they are taking a stake in the new venture. Unlike a loan, the investment is not a liability and does not need to be paid back.  This means the investor is taking much more of a risk than would a bank or lender. Leading sources of equity investment include private individuals, private equity companies, other companies, and venture capital firms. </p>
			<p>The equity investor gets a return either from dividend payments from the venture, which are typically unlikely because all profits are being reinvested in the business, or from appreciation in the value of the shares they own in the venture.  So, the returns to investors are dependent on the profitability and growth rate of the venture. For the share value to increase enough to offset the significant risk being taken by the investor, the venture must be growing at a very high rate. It typically must be a scalable venture. Low income entrepreneurs generally start ventures that do not have the kind of growth potential required by equity investors.  Again, there are numerous exceptions, but if the entrepreneur is starting a survival or lifestyle business, the likelihood of attracting equity funding is almost zero. Even managed growth ventures struggle to get equity investors. </p>
			<p>For low income entrepreneurs that have unique venture concepts and high growth aspirations,  the most likely source of equity investment is likely to come from angel investors.  Business angels are wealthy individuals who want to invest their own money in high growth businesses. They bring money, expertise, skills and contacts to the business. Finding a right business angel is key, as it is just as much about the relationship between the angel and the entrepreneur, as it is about the venture itself. While difficult to find in low income neighborhoods, the larger urban region is likely to have many angels, and today most have angel networks (groups of angels that collaborate in reviewing and investing in start-ups).  This is another example of how the low income entrepreneur’s social network and opportunity horizon limit the venture possibilities unless they are expanded. Yet, with tenacity these angels can be reached.</p>
			<p>A different equity-based approach is to involve a partner in the business who has money. Usually someone from the local community, this happens with low income entrepreneurs more often than one might expect. The entrepreneur finds a person with both business experience and money who believes enough in him/her and the business concept that they will partner with the entrepreneur, putting money into the venture and taking a share of the ownership.  Such partners are generally active in running the business (although they need not be, serving instead as behind-the-scenes advisors), and so it is important to find people who complement the skills of, and have consistent goals and values with, the entrepreneur. </p>
			<p>Much more problematic are venture capital firms and private equity companies as sources of money for the poor. Venture capitalists (VC) manage large funds (often over $100 million) where the minimum investment in a venture is $1 to $3 million, usually in businesses that have already achieved significant revenues. They demand a large proportion of the entrepreneur’s equity, and want to see rates of return on their investment of 40 percent or higher. Not surprisingly, low-income communities normally do not have access to venture capital and the VC investment model does not fit the needs of the low income entrepreneur. Yet, there are exceptions.  For instance, the New Markets Venture Capital program (NMVC), administrated by the U.S. Small Business Administration, was created to encourage venture capital investment in low-income urban and rural communities in order to create jobs and entrepreneurial capacity in places where traditional venture capital funds typically do not invest. In 2006, the NMVC funds invested more than $48 million in 75 companies in poor areas of the U.S., and were able to leverage $136 million in investments from other sources (CDVCA, 2006). This suggests that equity investments in low-income, underinvested settings are viable, and that a contagious effect can result from once the investments begin. </p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>Emerging Sources of Finance for Low Income Entrepreneurs</b></u></h4>
			<p>The explosive interest in entrepreneurship around the world has also produced a growing focus on alternative ways to fund start-up activity, with a number of developments that directly affect the poor. Four important sources of money have emerged:  microcredit, crowdsourcing, small business grants, and customer funding. Let us consider each in turn.  </p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>a) The Microcredit Revolution</b></i></h5>
			<p>Another form of debt financing is call microcredit or micro-finance.  Microcredit is the provision of relatively small loans to impoverished borrowers who do not meet conventional bank requirements in terms of collateral, income, and credit history. It came to prominence based on the highly successful work of Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.  The Grameen Bank self-supports a diverse mix of poor people by means of very small loans on easy, extended terms without requiring collateral. Their work is based on the assumption that the poor can manage their own finances and develop their own futures through sustainable ventures. Their trademark methodology of group lending (a small number of individuals who want to start businesses constitute a group, receive training together, and receive a loan from Grameen Bank) allows the poor to start a business without having to engage in expensive moneylenders programs. Group lending uses the trust of fellow members as collateral, and the members receive loans as long as all members continue current payments. In reflecting on the success of microcredit, the impressive results of these programs have caught the attention of policy makers and a variety of organizations across the globe. Subsequently, microenterprise development organizations have emerged not only throughout the developing world, but also in most developed economies.  As a result, the past thirty years have witnessed dramatic increases in the number of microcredit programs, the amount of funding available, and the volume of entrepreneurs who have been assisted (Edgcomb, 2002; Servon, 2006a). These include the poor, women, minorities, the disabled, victims of disasters, displaced workers, public assistance recipients, immigrants, farm workers, and others. Search portals have also appeared that enable people to locate microcredit providers, including the Microfinance Gateway (To visit the website, <a href = "http://www.microfinancegateway.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.) which covers all regions of the world, and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (https://aeoworks.org) in the U.S.</p>
			<p>Microcredit programs can offer a range of services, including savings accounts, insurance, credit and loans, and money transfers, financial advice, mentoring, procurement assistant (i.e., for government and corporate contracts), business incubators, and personal financial management training. The latter is an especially critical reason for the success of these programs, as giving people money when they do not have the appropriate skills and knowledge can be counter-productive.  Through such training the poor learn to save, manage money, understand cash flow, separate personal from business finances, interpret simple financial statements, keep proper records, and master the basic terms (language) related to finance and accounting.  </p>
			<p>A large number of international organizations are involved in microfinance.  For example, the Grameen Bank now has operations in multiple countries, including some developed economies such as U.S and Japan.  ACCION helps launch and makes investments in microfinance lenders around the world, helping them achieve scale and sustainability, while also investing in companies that offer products to people living in poverty.  The CrediAmigo microfinance program offered by Brazil’s Banco do Nordeste, with support from the World Bank, has become the largest provider of microfinance in South America.</p>
			<p>In the United States, there are over 600 microcredit programs today, with significant data to support their effectiveness (Aspen Institute, 2017). Their typical loans range from $1000 -$50,000 (the average is just over $7,000 with an average interest rate of 8%), and they are most typically run by nonprofit organizations with funding coming from government agencies, foundations, businesses, and private citizens.  Microcredit initiatives also exist at the national, regional and local levels. For instance, Self-Help, which is a community development financial institution (CDFI) operating in four different states, has a model where they act as a credit union and nonprofit loan fund, and provide support both for mortgages and business (including nonprofit ventures) ownership.  An example at a local level is The Loan Fund in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, which makes loans of $5,000 to $100,000 to low-income people, women, and minorities who may not qualify for conventional financing. </p>
			<p>The growth and sophistication of microcredit as a form a finance is likely to further accelerate in the coming years. Despite the fact that the organizations making these loans are not self-sufficient, they are producing noteworthy results.  Data from the Field Program of the Aspen Institute indicate that microloans yield significant increases in income and job creation for start-up ventures, while improving credit scores for the entrepreneurs (Aspen Institute, 2017). A sizeable percentage (as much as 60 percent) of poor entrepreneurs receiving these loans move out of poverty, with dramatic decreases in the reliance on public assistance or welfare.</p>
			<p>When done properly, microcredit also influences the development of other policies and programs to alleviate poverty in impoverished neighborhoods, and can serve as a core element of an integrative strategy to build social and financial capital in those problematic areas. Relationships within programs are formed among and between borrowers, program staff, and a larger support network.  These relationships can contribute to self-efficacy among the poor, provide vicarious learning and role models, and enable partnerships and the leveraging of other community resources by entrepreneurs. They represent an important opportunity for the poor to enlarge their opportunity horizon as they are exposed to different realities, stories, information and knowledge. In general, microfinance programs have helped large numbers of people escape poverty through self-employment, and contributed in important ways to the economic development of distressed regions. </p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>b) Crowdfunding</b></i></h5>
			<p>Another important non-traditional source of financing that is rapidly growing is crowd-funding.  It represents a request for funding from the general public, usually through dedicated platforms on the Internet, either in form of donation or in exchange for the future product or some form of reward. The basic idea is to raise small amounts of money (as low as $1) from large numbers (potentially millions) of people. From a business perspective, crowdfunding is beneficial because it gives access to financial resources, and it also provides a good opportunity to comments and suggestions to fine-tune projects, services or products, serving as a community building activity. </p>
			<p>Today there are over a thousand of these platforms. These include <i>equity-based crowdfunding platforms</i> (i.e., underwriting by the crowd of the risk capital issued by a company), <i>lending-based crowdfunding platforms</i> (i.e., underwriting of debt contracts between two parties, as the lender and the borrower), <i>reward-based crowdfunding platforms</i> (i.e., financing is provided in the expectation of a rewards or a prize, material or not) and <i>donation-based crowdfunding platforms</i> (i.e., project funding motivated by philanthropy or sponsorship, without any other remuneration for crowdfunders (e.g., Belleflamme, Lambert, and Schwienbacher, 2014). The donation-based crowdfunding platforms are the most common when it comes to ventures created by those in poverty. Funds are raised for start-up activities, to support growth, and to assist ventures that are in trouble.  Yet, the availability of crowd-based funds for the poor is much less prominent than the use of these platforms to support other types of ventures and activities.</p>
			<p>Crowdfunding can support the poor in different ways.  Benevolent is a platform that helps low income individuals overcome economic hurdles, such as helping them buy a car or acquire a computer.  The Wishbone platform provides funding to help poor high school students attend special university programs (Thorpe, 2013). GoFundMe promotes itself as the world’s largest social fundraising platforms, and will raise money for everything from a medical emergency or funeral to schooling and community events.  They include categories for entrepreneurial start-ups and existing small businesses, and many of these are not high tech and/or higher growth types of ventures that are often funded through such popular platforms as Kickstarter, RocketHub, AngelList and MicroVentures.  IndiGoGo also funds an eclectic mix of projects, including local businesses. The platform that most caters to the ventures of the poor is arguably KIVA, which combines microlending with crowdfunding.  Loans are crowdfunded in amounts of $25 or more, and when borrowers repay, the money can be used for new loans, as donations, or withdrawn by the lender. </p>
			<p>The use of the crowdfunding model as a vehicle to support the poor is producing promising results, clearly indicating that there is a willingness and availability to gather a high number of people donating a small amount of money to support entrepreneurship under adverse conditions (Attuel-Mendès, 2014).  Yet, their potential is significantly unrealized when it comes to adapting these platforms to reflect the distinct needs of the poor at a local level. </p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>c) Grants for Small Businesses</b></i></h5>
			<p>Low income entrepreneurs are often surprised to find there is a relative dearth of grant programs to support entrepreneurs, and particularly low income entrepreneurs that are not working on advancing a technology or developing a leading edge innovation. Someone starting a non-profit is more likely to find grant money than a person launching a for-profit venture. Grants are attractive because they do not involve debt or equity. They generally have few strings, in that they do not need to be paid back, while other restrictions, if any, tend to be limited to specifying what the money can be spent for. They are highly competitive, usually with a set of criteria the applying entrepreneur must meet to be eligible, and most often requiring a written business plan and a follow up report once the money is spent. </p>
			<p>In the United States, hundreds of grant programs for entrepreneurs exist, but when spread across the entire country or whole states, it is enough to support only a very small percentage of start-ups.  Moreover, the majority of these are not focused on the poor. The Small Business Administration has small business grants for innovation and technology transfer projects for entrepreneurs already in business. However, they also administer the PRIME Program, which provides grants to state and local organizations to support programs that benefit entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The Minority Business Development Agency (also part of the U.S. Department of Commerce) has regular grant competitions for minority business owners and attempt to connect minority entrepreneurs to other funding sources. Also at a federal level, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, and other federal government departments have competitive grant programs for businesses that address particular problems or needs that each agency has prioritized---and most of these focus on technology and innovation (e.g., green technologies for the Environmental Protection Agency, Cyber Security for the Department of Homeland Security). Programs also exist to support particular venture categories, such as farmers and ventures that provide services to at-risk children. Most individual states run grant programs. A few have a broad mandate that includes minorities and the poor, such as the Maryland Economic Development Assistance Fund. Most encourage ventures with a specific focus, such as those involved in export activity, community infrastructure needs, tourism-related activities, recycling, transportation, child care, technology development, and agriculture, among other specific areas of emphasis.  Some also emphasize particular groups, such as veterans or women. At a community level, many cities, local economic development, minority assistance agencies, and some chambers of commerce provide grants to small businesses that create jobs, improve their facilities, or locate in particular areas---most often businesses that are already operating, but also start-ups. </p>
			<p>Private companies have also introduced grant programs, and these are highly selective and small in number. For example, each year Fedex offers grants of up to $25,000 to ten small businesses, while Chase Bank provides $3 million to twenty main street businesses having a community impact, Kimberly Clark offers twelve grants of $15,000 to mothers attempting to start businesses, and Eileen Fisher has $100,000 for ten women-owned ventures. Some companies, such as Anheuser Busch with its Miller Lite Tap the Future Competition, award money to winning entrepreneurs for their ventures. A large number of local business plan or pitch competitions with cash prizes can be found in many cities. Again, the ventures of the poor struggle to be competitive in such competitions. Finally, a few foundations have grant programs for defined groups, such as the Open Meadows Foundation (for women) and StreetShares Foundation (veterans).</p>
			<p>While not an actual grant, another noteworthy set of initiatives attempts to award government contracts or tenders to economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs.  For instance, the U.S. government offers the 8(a) Business Development Program that offers a range of assistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Included here are access to sole-source (non-competitive) and competitive contracts to provide products or services to government agencies.  Many local governments, universities and private corporations also has special set-aside programs to award contracts to minority and disadvantaged business owners, some of which also include mentor-protégé programs where potential entrepreneurs get mentored by successful entrepreneurs and other experts. </p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>d) Customer Funding</b></i></h5>
			<p>While often overlooked, another vehicle for financing a venture is through customer funding. Some highly successful ventures have relied on this approach, including Airbnb, Dell Computers, and the Banana Republic.  Mullins (2014) has identified some general approaches to customer funding. For the poor, the most relevant is probably the pay in advance model, where customers pay for a product or service and then the entrepreneur produces or acquires it. This approach is sometimes used with crowdfunding campaigns where people are incentive to contribute funds with the offer of a product once the fundraising is successfully completed.  A variation of having customers pay in advance is requiring customers to put a deposit down prior to receiving a product or service. Also relevant is the subscription model, where the customer agrees to buy the product or service over an extended period of time, paying a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription fee ahead of actually receiving all of the goods or services. So-called matchmaker models find the entrepreneur serving as a type of middlemen, earning money from buyers and sellers for bring them together (such as with Airbnb), while not actually owning what is being sold. Playing a go-between role is not uncommon among people in poverty (Chau, Goto & Kanbur, 2016), but here the focus is generating cash flow from the activity. The deliver and re-sell model involves winning a contract to create something for one customer and then reselling a variant of that product to a broader markets.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>e) Local Community Savings Schemes</b></i></h5>
			<p>Lastly, different versions of rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) can be a means for low income entrepreneurs to raise money for a venture.  Let’s say eight individuals are each trying to acquire an asset of some kind (e.g., a vehicle, computer, power washing system, or sewing machine). Here, the group of individuals decides to partner for a defined period of time.  Each pays an equal amount money into a common fund on a weekly, monthly or otherwise regular basis.  Once the fund has accumulated enough money, one of the entrepreneurs is able to use the money to make a purchase, while all of them continue to make their regular payments into the fund.  It then rotates to the next person, and then the next, until all have been able to buy the asset. ROSCAs are a form of peer-to-peer lending where many variations are possible depending on the capabilities and needs to the individuals involved. For instance, the group might simply pay into a fund without anyone taking money out until someone needs funds for a particular purpose. Alternatively, the group might each pay in monthly with one person taking this month’s total to use in their venture, and the next person taking next month’s total. </p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><b><u>The Ongoing Gap in Funding</b></u></h4>
			<p>Funding a business is a big challenge for anyone, but for those in poverty the task can be overwhelming. As we have seen, a variety of financing sources are available to low income entrepreneurs, depending on how far along they are in the process. As a generalization, the earlier the entrepreneur is, the less money is available.  The person in poverty typically has little personal savings and few assets (including intellectual property) to invest in a business, and the same is generally true for their friends and families. They have a more difficult time qualifying for credit-based financing, and characteristics of their ventures (and their limited social networks) make obtaining equity finance much more unlikely.  The bias in traditional venture funding is towards established ventures that have significant growth prospects. It is also towards technology-based businesses with exciting new innovations.  Some of the newer or emerging sources of money, such as microcredit, grants and crowdfunding, while promising, are able only funding a very small number of low income start-ups each year. </p>
			<p>A large gap continues to plague people in poverty who want to start something.  Some of this is due to shortcomings in their backgrounds and experience. Financial literacy is paramount in this regard.  Another contributor is the types of ventures started by the poor, especially when they operate in highly competitive and relative mature markets, are labor intensive, lack differentiation, attempt to compete on price, and are able to spend little on technology. </p>
			<p>There is a critical need not just for more investment in the start-up concepts of the poor, but funding that reflects needs of these entrepreneurs as the progress through their entrepreneurial journey. Simply distinguishing those in the pre-venture stage from those already in business is insufficient.  An integrated approach, particularly at the local level, should include a combined mix of microcredit, grants and crowdfunding opportunities. Both funding and the connected training, mentoring, apprenticeship, and contracting support initiatives should then be specifically tailored to the ideation, pre-start-up, start-up, stabilization and growth stages of the venture. Amounts of funding should be directly tied to goals and deliverables produced by the entrepreneur at each stage. The community of low income entrepreneurs, once successful, should play an instrumental role in guiding these programs.</p>

			<h4><b><u>Getting It Done Without Financing:  Leveraging, Bootstrapping and Guerrilla</b></u></h4>
			<p>If we assume that the entrepreneur has very little money and limited access to the money of others, which it typically the case for low income entrepreneurs, this need not be a reason for not starting a venture. The keys are to think entrepreneurially, and learn how to bootstrap, leverage and be a guerrilla.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><u><b>a) The Bootstrapping Concept</b></u></h5>
			<p>Bootstrapping refers to using the resources the entrepreneur has at hand to accomplish outcomes. The entrepreneur is starting a venture with very little money, and pulls himself or herself up by the bootstraps.  It is a proactive attempt to make the most of things under the entrepreneur’s control. Absent any outside funding, the individual instead uses his/her own resources (including credit cards), does as many tasks himself or herself (e.g., figures out how to create their own website or keep their own books), and stretches resources to the limit.  The low income entrepreneur is bootstrapping when paying bills as late as possible while collecting from customers as early as possible, using unpaid interns, selling on consignment, using supplier credit, and accelerating receivables.</p>
			<br></br><br></br>
			
			<h5><u><b>b) The Leveraging Concept</b></u></h5>
			<p>It is normal to assume that if one wants to do something innovative like start a business, it will cost money, and that if one needs a resource, I have to find the money to buy it.  Yet, this is a misguided notion, especially for the low income entrepreneur. Purchasing or owning the resource should more typically be is the last option considered, not the first.</p>
			<p>How does one gain access to a resource without purchasing it? It becomes necessary to rely upon the diverse mix of things that are at hand or readily available. In the contemporary environment, the low income entrepreneur focuses on the concept of resource leveraging---and is core to every resource decision that he or she makes. To leverage is multiply the outcome of one’s efforts without a corresponding increase in the consumption of resources. Consider a man trying to move a large boulder who finds he simply does not have the strength to move it. But by placing with a length of pipe or timber (a lever) under the boulder, he is able to move it. So the low-income entrepreneur must look for levers.</p>
			<p>When launching and growing a venture, leveraging can involve:</p>
			<p>• Using someone else’s resources;</p>
			<p>• Doing more with fewer resources;</p>
			<p>• Mobilizing a resource that others do not typically recognize as a resource;</p>
			<p>• Utilizing resources in ways they have not traditionally been used;</p>
			<p>• Playing resources off of one another to accomplish results;</p>
			<p>• Combining resources in novel ways to accomplish an outcome.</p>
			<p>In practice, leveraging can take a number of forms. Table 1 elaborates on thirteen specific types of leveraging approaches.  Entrepreneurs can borrow, share, or rent the resource. They can outsource, partner or collaborate with a competitor to get the resource. They can play resources off of one another or capitalize on their personal status.</p>
			<p>Consider two examples, the first involving social entrepreneurship. A community soup kitchen leverages relationships with local three- and four-star restaurants to acquire their excess food at the end of each evening, while also enhancing cash flow by leveraging the basic soup kitchen facilities to start a catering business featuring ex-convicts as the wait staff. Going further, an innovative program is developed with local public schools, bartering for use of the school kitchens during the hours they are not used in exchange for teaching culinary skills to students, and in the process producing more meals for disadvantaged members of the community. A second example can be found by considering a young man whose dream is to bring enhanced computer literacy to the inner city.  He starts a business that involves computer classes, a low-cost internet café, and rebuilt computers sold for low prices. He initially offers the classes in local churches, and is able to get free announcements in the church bulletins.  He visits a new radio station that is serving this community and barters for a fifteen-minute radio show on technology topics in exchange for some computers and computer training for the radio station staff. He makes a similar offer to a woman who owns a house on a prominent traffic intersection in exchange for advertising his business on the side of her house. Instead of using an employment agency or help wanted ads, he hires as employees the best students taking his courses. </p>
			<p>When leveraging, there are three questions the low income entrepreneur continually attempts to address:</p>
			<p>1. What internal resources do I have that I am not fully utilizing?</p>
			<p>(e.g., extent to which I am making full use of my website, packaging, vehicles, sales and service people, or any other assets under our control);</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>2. How well am I leveraging relationships with people or companies in my network?</p>
			<p>(e.g., extent to which I am capitalizing on relationships with suppliers, vendors, producers of related products or services, financiers, distributors, and customers);</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>3. What untapped or underutilized resources exist in the community or marketplace?</p>
			<p>(e.g., extent to which I have attempted to utilize churches that are not used for many hours of the day, kids who are opinion leaders, houses on prominent corners, walls in restrooms, table tops, car bumpers, abandoned buildings, school kitchens during summer, stay at home moms or dads).</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>No matter a person’s status in life or how limited their financial capital, and regardless of the kind of business they are trying to start, resources are abundant.  Realizing this requires that the person does not assume resources have to be purchased or owned. To leverage is to empower the individual by creatively finding ways of accessing what they do not own. In fact, because of technological advances that have seeped into every walk of life, we exist in a time where much more can be accessed by entrepreneurs for much less. </p>

				<h4><u><b>Table 1: Thirteen Examples of Leveraging Strategies</b></u></h4>
				<p><b>• Borrow:</b>   Using a resource owned by someone else on a temporary basis, particularly when they are not using it, such as a vehicle, tool or employee;</p>
				<p><b>• Barter:</b>   Provide a service or product or give some other asset in exchange for the resource;</p>
				<p><b>• Share:</b>  Utilize excess capacity, unused space or some other underutilized resource owned by someone else, such as an empty office, a machine when the business is closed, or a prominent area where messages might be posted;</p>
				<p><b>• Contract:</b>  Sign a contract to use the resource for a fixed term rather than be committed to it indefinitely, such as a temporary employment contract;</p>
				<p><b>• Lease or rent:</b> rather than purchase the resource, attempt to lease or rent it for a defined period of time;</p>
				<p><b>• Outsource:</b>  instead of doing a task or function yourself, and having to purchase the necessary equipment, tools and supplies to do so, rely on an outside firm to provide the function or service, thereby lessening your fixed investment;</p>
				<p><b>• License:</b> Use someone else’s property (often intellectual property) by paying a licensing fee tied to activity or usage, such as where you are charged per unit fees for the amount of the item that you make, use or sell;  </p>
				<p><b>• Partner:</b> Form a business partnership with the resource provider in order to use a resource they control;</p>
				<p><b>• Consignment:</b> Rather than purchase the inventory, sell things owned by others on consignment, where you pay them only when an item is sold;</p>
				<p><b>• Give equity:</b>  Give the resource provider partial ownership in the company in exchange for the resource;</p>
				<p><b>• Ham and egg:</b>  Use one resource to obtain another, such as where you use the fact that you are doing business with a certain customer in order to get business from another customer, or you are thinking about hiring a particular person because hiring that person might make your business more attractive to someone else you are trying to hire;</p>
				<p><b>• Collaborate with other businesses:</b> Rather than simply compete, look for areas where you can collaborate with other firms, such as joint purchasing arrangements to achieve volume discounts;</p>
				<p><b>• Exploit personal status:</b>  Take advantage of your status as a minority, women, veteran, disabled person, or based on some other personal characteristic in order to win a contract, get a loan, or obtain some other resource.</p>

			<h5><u><b>c) The Guerrilla Concept</b></u></h5>
			<p>Related to bootstrapping and leveraging is the concept of guerrilla behavior. The history of warfare is replete with examples of smaller, weaker, under-resourced combatants who manage to defeat more powerful foes by engaging in clever,  unconventional tactics, utilizing the unexpected ambush, taking advantage of surroundings or environmental conditions, employing stealth, and relying on mobility, speed and the element of surprise.  It goes back to the biblical story of David and Goliath. </p>
			<p>Applied in an entrepreneurial context, guerrilla behavior is one of the more prevalent perspectives on how entrepreneurs can pursue opportunity when faced with severe resource constraints is termed guerrilla behavior.  In a new venture context, guerrilla behavior is most often applied to selling and marketing, an area where the low income entrepreneur often has no resources. It refers to novel system of tactics that relies on time, energy and imagination rather than a large budget. The efforts are creative and unconventional, potentially interactive, and consumers are targeted in unexpected places.</p>
			<p>Consider the case of the new pizza restaurant in an urban area that decides to feed and pay homeless people to hold up hand-scrawled messages at locations throughout the city attesting to the fact that they are homeless, have tried every kind of pizza, and believe this restaurant offers the best pizza. Such a tactic is certainly clever, non-conventional, unexpected, and utilizes as a resource something that most others would not view as a resource. Another example is the entrepreneur who starts a restaurant, but runs out of money and so is unable to promote the new business.  Undaunted by this obstacle, he/she decides to have a party in the restaurant just before the grand opening.  Only one type of person is invited to the party. The entrepreneur invites every hairdresser in the town to a fun, festive and free party.  Hairdressers tend to talk all day as part of their jobs, and for many months after the party they are likely to mention this restaurant in very positive terms.  This kind of free publicity can produce more powerful results than spending large sums of money (that the low income person does not have) on conventional advertising on radio or the internet. </p>
			<p>As with leveraging, guerrilla tactics are dependent on the entrepreneur’s creativity and resourcefulness. The possibilities are limitless, Examples include co-marketing with other firms, finding opinion leaders and giving them your product, taking advantage of the surroundings such as putting up fliers on backs of restroom doors or putting table top tents on tables in popular areas, creating buzz by making some seemingly outrageous offer to customers, placing products in other people’s businesses or ads, doing something provocative that attracts free news coverage, and advertising on grocery carts, floors or ceilings. </p>
			<p>By thinking as a guerilla, the low income entrepreneur finds alternative ways to communicate with customers, create visibility, and build a brand. Guerrilla methods enable the entrepreneur to reach markets and customers that would seem unattainable without large marketing budgets and extensive distribution channels. They can also convey an image of an entrepreneur who is clever, different, fun, and is working hard to get the customer’s business. </p>
