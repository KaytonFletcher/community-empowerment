      <!-- The 6 divs below are the text that will appear when clicking on a letter-->
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-s">The framework begins with development of a supportive infrastructure (S).  Low income neighborhoods generally lack an entrepreneurial ecosystem, and the poor struggle to tap into whatever ecosystems exist within the larger community or region. Importantly, the infrastructure must reflect the unique conditions and needs of the poor, as outlined earlier in this chapter. Key infrastructure elements include education/training mechanisms, availability of finance, incubators/accelerators, a supportive business community, vehicles for social networking/connecting, small business support organizations, small business service providers, entrepreneurial role models, and entrepreneurial mentors, among others.</div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-p">We then focus on the low income individual and their preparation (P) for the entrepreneurial journey. Gaps and shortcomings in the individual’s background must be addressed as he/she learns to master business and entrepreneurial competencies. Thus, it is critical to prepare individuals in low-income conditions to become entrepreneurs, providing them with the knowledge, tactics and tools to think and act more entrepreneurially.</div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-o">Next, entrepreneurship is opportunity-driven behavior, and our focus becomes the opportunity horizon (O) of the entrepreneur.  Here the priority is to continually extend this horizon, enabling the low income individual to recognize more attractive and higher potential possibilities both as the basis for launching the venture, but also to enable ongoing growth and expansion of the business. Based on the market opportunity, a business is conceptualized. All too often, the value proposition on which the business is based is not sufficiently unique.</div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-d">When this happens, customers see the business as a commodity.  It becomes difficult for the entrepreneur to achieve sustainable differentiation (D) from competitors.  The key is strategic thinking, as opposed to reactive or tactical management, as sources of differentiation exist for virtually any business.</div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-e">Then, the business designed by the low-income entrepreneur must be developed around a viable economic model (E). This typically means not trying to compete with high unit costs, relatively small volumes, and low prices and margins. Rather, the entrepreneur must find innovative ways to capture revenue, price on a value basis, achieve cost economies while keeping overhead low, and reach higher potential market segments.</div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-r">Finally, the low-income entrepreneur must continually acquire resources (R), which includes not only money, but a wide range of other tangible and intangible resources.  However, the key concept here is resource leveraging, which means finding creative ways to borrow, share, rent, outsource, barter, partner and otherwise tap into resources not owned by the entrepreneur, including community resources.  It involves recognizing things as resources that others do not, taking advantage of one’s surroundings, and using resources in non-conventional ways. The model is presented as a circle. This shape reflects the fact that a cycle is involved, one that is ongoing as the venture interfaces with the infrastructure to gain new inputs, and the entrepreneur continually learns and improves, new market opportunities are discovered, enhanced sources of differentiation are identified, the economic model is refined, and resources are leveraged to enable venture growth.</div>

        Us is a 2019 American horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele.
        The film stars Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph,
        Evan Alex, Elisabeth Moss, and Tim Heidecker, and follows a family who are confronted by their doppelgängers.
        The project was first announced in February 2018, and much of the cast joined that summer.
        Peele produced the film alongside Jason Blum and Sean McKittrick (with the trio previously having collaborated
        on Get Out and BlacKkKlansman), as well as Ian Cooper. Filming took place from July to October 2018 in California.
        
        Us had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 8, 2019
        and was theatrically released in the United States on March 22, 2019, by Universal Pictures.
        The film has grossed $113 million worldwide and received praise from critics for Peele's screenplay and direction,
        as well as for the musical score and acting.
