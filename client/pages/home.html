        Us is a 2019 American horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele.
        The film stars Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph,
        Evan Alex, Elisabeth Moss, and Tim Heidecker, and follows a family who are confronted by their doppelg√§ngers.
        The project was first announced in February 2018, and much of the cast joined that summer.
        Peele produced the film alongside Jason Blum and Sean McKittrick (with the trio previously having collaborated
        on Get Out and BlacKkKlansman), as well as Ian Cooper. Filming took place from July to October 2018 in California.
        
        Us had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 8, 2019
        and was theatrically released in the United States on March 22, 2019, by Universal Pictures.
        The film has grossed $113 million worldwide and received praise from critics for Peele's screenplay and direction,
        as well as for the musical score and acting.
