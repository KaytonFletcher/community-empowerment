      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-s">The framework begins with development of a <b>supportive</b> infrastructure (S).  Low income neighborhoods generally lack an entrepreneurial ecosystem, and the poor struggle to tap into whatever ecosystems exist within the larger community or region. Importantly, the infrastructure must reflect the unique conditions and needs of the poor, as outlined earlier in this chapter. Key infrastructure elements include education/training mechanisms, availability of finance, incubators/accelerators, a supportive business community, vehicles for social networking/connecting, small business support organizations, small business service providers, entrepreneurial role models, and entrepreneurial mentors, among others. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/S" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-p">We then focus on the low income individual and their <b>preparation</b> (P) for the entrepreneurial journey. Gaps and shortcomings in the individual’s background must be addressed as he/she learns to master business and entrepreneurial competencies. Thus, it is critical to prepare individuals in low-income conditions to become entrepreneurs, providing them with the knowledge, tactics and tools to think and act more entrepreneurially. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/P" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div></div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-o">Next, entrepreneurship is opportunity-driven behavior, and our focus becomes the <b>opportunity</b> horizon (O) of the entrepreneur.  Here the priority is to continually extend this horizon, enabling the low income individual to recognize more attractive and higher potential possibilities both as the basis for launching the venture, but also to enable ongoing growth and expansion of the business. Based on the market opportunity, a business is conceptualized. All too often, the value proposition on which the business is based is not sufficiently unique. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/O" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div></div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-d">When this happens, customers see the business as a commodity.  It becomes difficult for the entrepreneur to achieve sustainable <b>differentiation</b> (D) from competitors.  The key is strategic thinking, as opposed to reactive or tactical management, as sources of differentiation exist for virtually any business. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/D" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div></div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-e">Then, the business designed by the low-income entrepreneur must be developed around a viable <b>economic</b> model (E). This typically means not trying to compete with high unit costs, relatively small volumes, and low prices and margins. Rather, the entrepreneur must find innovative ways to capture revenue, price on a value basis, achieve cost economies while keeping overhead low, and reach higher potential market segments. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/E" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div></div>
      <div class="slide-content spoderslide-r">Finally, the low-income entrepreneur must continually acquire <b>resources</b> (R), which includes not only money, but a wide range of other tangible and intangible resources.  However, the key concept here is resource leveraging, which means finding creative ways to borrow, share, rent, outsource, barter, partner and otherwise tap into resources not owned by the entrepreneur, including community resources.  It involves recognizing things as resources that others do not, taking advantage of one’s surroundings, and using resources in non-conventional ways. The model is presented as a circle. This shape reflects the fact that a cycle is involved, one that is ongoing as the venture interfaces with the infrastructure to gain new inputs, and the entrepreneur continually learns and improves, new market opportunities are discovered, enhanced sources of differentiation are identified, the economic model is refined, and resources are leveraged to enable venture growth. <br><b><i>To learn more, click <a href="/R" target="_self">here</a>.</i></b></br></div></div>

      <div class='aboutus'>
      Entrepreneurship Empowerment is a group dedicated to giving people access to the tools and information needed to become a knowledgeable entrepreneur. 
      Our organization is led by UF's Dr. Michael H. Morris who holds the George and Lisa Etheridge Professorship at the University of Florida, 
      where he is the Academic Director of the Entrepreneurship Program. He previously was the N. Malone 
      Mitchell Chair and founded the School of Entrepreneurship at Oklahoma State University, and before 
      that launched the Department of Entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. The entrepreneurship 
      programs he has built at three different universities have been ranked in the top ten nationally 
      and received global recognition for excellence. Dr. Morris is a pioneer in curricular innovation 
      and experiential learning. His entrepreneurial outreach efforts have facilitated the development 
      of hundreds of ventures, and he has started three ventures of his own. A former Fulbright Scholar,
      Dr. Morris was selected as a top twenty entrepreneurship professor by Fortune Small Business, and
      received the Leavey Award from the Freedoms Foundation for impacting private enterprise education.
