			<h4><b><u>Introduction</b></u></h4>
			<p>Based on the market opportunity, a business is conceptualized. With low income entrepreneurs, all too often the value proposition on which the business is based is not sufficiently unique. As a result, they fall into what we might call “the commodity trap”.</p>
			<p>It starts with having a business that is by and large selling something that is not meaningfully different from what many others in the same market are selling.  When customers see no difference among competitors, they buy from whomever has the lowest price or is the most convenient to buy from.  They have no loyalties, and effectively see the purchase as a commodity.  Firms are forced to compete on price rather than on some other basis.  Competing on price is almost always a losing proposition. Margins are squeezed as firms attempt to undercut one another in order to retain or gain customers.  Meanwhile, operating costs keep rising, further cutting into margins. The problem is exacerbated when operating in more mature or saturated markets, where there is little to no growth in the size or spending levels of the overall customer base. With smaller margins, the entrepreneur has less to reinvest in the business or take home. Lack of reinvestment means the business only becomes more of a commodity, especially if other firms are trying new and different things.</p>
			<p>Consider the kinds of ventures often started by those living in poverty conditions.  Painting contractors, child care providers, equipment repair businesses, cleaning services, moving or delivery companies, small restaurants, convenience stores and other small shops, among others, all have one thing in common. They can easily be perceived as commodity businesses by customers, and the entrepreneur is forced to keep prices low no matter what happens to operating costs.  Of course, the entrepreneur generally believes their business is different in some way, but this is meaningless if the customer does not see or value the difference.</p>
			<p>The goal must be to create meaningful and sustainable differentiation.  This means offering something unique that creates real value for enough customers.  This can represent a unique challenge for someone who is poor. They first must recognize potential sources of meaningful differentiation, which can require an in-depth understanding of customers, competitors, supplier capabilities, and available technologies. From a more general perspective, new businesses differentiate themselves from others in many ways, including the quality of their offerings, the kinds of experiences they create for customers, their ability to customize, support after the sale, and value for the money, among others. </p>
			<p>A more specific approach to uncovering sources of differentiation can be found in Figure 1. This framework encourages the entrepreneur to look at what they are selling at four levels. The core level involves translating what is being sold into the primary benefit being delivered to customers.  An entrepreneur that makes uniforms for local companies is not really selling uniforms, they are selling professionalism or image benefits.  The tangible level refers to aspects of the basic product or service itself, such as the quality level or the selection available.  The augmented level concerns ways in which the basic product or service might be augmented, such as by providing delivery, a warranty, or easy return policy.  Lastly, the communicated level has to do with a unique identity or image the company is trying to convey to customers. A cleaning company might try to project itself as environmentally conscious based on the types of cleaning products and disposal practices it uses, or as a socially-concerned business based on employing the disabled or relying on equitable labor practices, or as patriotic based on hiring vets, the colors on it vehicles, and the community events it sponsors.</p>
			<p>Using the framework in Figure 1 (and additional variables can be added at each level depending on the venture in question), the low income entrepreneur is able to identify variables or combinations of variables that can enable differentiation. This applies to even the most basic of business types.  Of particular importance is the need to find sources of difference that are not as easy for competitors to copy given their resource configurations.</p>

			<p>Once one or more sources of differentiation are identified, the entrepreneur must build their value offering around this difference. Doing so is not easy for the low income entrepreneur. Like segmentation and targeting, differentiation requires discipline. The entrepreneur is worried that differentiating in a particular way might alienate other potential customers who are not attracted to this difference. But attracting a lot of people who value the source of differentiation will pay off far more than the returns from going after anyone and everyone with a generic approach that is not unlike what a number of competitors are doing. Further, where customers perceive a difference and it is a difference they value, they are often willing to pay more and demonstrate more loyalty to the business. </p>
			<p>Differentiation also requires an investment of time, effort, and money, and has to be continually reinforced in the minds of customers.  For someone in poverty, identifying the source of differentiation early on is critical.  Once resources are configured in a particularly way, it can be quite costly to change the configuration in ways that create a meaningful difference in terms of how the venture is perceived.  The entrepreneur caught in the commodity trap can find themselves in a downward cycle without the additional resources and available time needed to break out of this cycle. </p>

			<h4><b><u>The Need to Segment and Target</u></b></h4>
			<p>All too often, when asked to describe their target audience, the low income entrepreneur will respond “everyone is a potential customer”. Desperate to survive, the entrepreneur who starts from poverty will tend to see anyone and everyone as a potential source of business.  This misconception holds many ventures from ever gaining traction in the marketplace.  They try to be all things to all people.</p>
			<p>In effect, the entrepreneur employs what is termed a shotgun approach to the market, when what is needed is a rifle approach. When firing a shotgun, the shot is sprayed everywhere. Even if the target is hit, typically a lot of other things are also hit.  Alternatively, when firing a properly-aimed rifle, the target is hit cleanly. There is no waste.  The low income entrepreneur does not have resources to waste, and so must employ rifle approaches when approaching the market. This means breaking the market down into segments, and focusing on particular segments that consist of customers with similar needs and buying behaviors.</p>
			<p>The segments can be defined by any number of characteristics. With under-resourced start-up ventures, the entrepreneur segments based on simple customer descriptors. Examples in include, among others, age, gender, employment status, marital status, type of residence, usage rates, and the key benefits sought when buying the product or service. Consider the entrepreneur who launches a cleaning business, but segments the market and concentrates efforts on selling to businesses, not households. Further, he emphasizes medical facilities, and further specializes in medical offices where one regularly must deal with biomedical waste.  Yet another entrepreneur owns a van and decides to create a transport business.  The decision is made to transport people, not goods. This market is further segmented based on the purpose and length of the trip, and the entrepreneur concludes that there is a unique opportunity in transporting people with disabilities who have Medicare coverage and want to visit a doctor located within ten miles.</p>
			<p>By engaging in segmentation and then targeting specific types of customers, the entrepreneur is not only more efficient in the use of their resources (i.e., less wastage on people who are unlikely to buy), but they can be more effective (i.e., product a bigger response from customers). They can design their product or service offering, prices, staffing, operating hours, and/or marketing approaches in ways that uniquely reflect the needs and approaches to buying of the targeted segments. </p>
			<p>Let's use a marketing example involving a low income entrepreneur with a takeaway food establishment located in a tough inner city community within a mid-sized metropolitan area. Almost all of her customers come from the local area around her establishment. Operating under the misplaced notion that everyone is a potential customer, she decides to run advertisements in the daily newspaper, which reaches about 150,000 people. She thinks this broad-based exposure could bring in a variety of new customers, such as local business professionals who work in the central business district, and students from a local university. But this never happens. Even with well-designed ads run a number of times, virtually no increase in customer volume occurs while the ads are running or afterwards. And the entrepreneur has now exhausted their marketing resources for at least the next twelve months. </p>
			<p>Alternatively, with some help from a local nonprofit that helps small businesses, this same entrepreneur is able to more thoroughly study the market and assess her current customer base. She comes to realize that the inner city community itself has a number of distinct market segments, none of which she is very heavily penetrating. Based on this, she decides to spend her limited marketing funds in a very different way. The marketing effort is now focused on churches attended by people in one or two of these segments. Specifically, she gets her business featured on the backs of the bulletins put out each Sunday by four local churches and sponsors some church events. She subsequently sees a significant increase revenues and repeat patronage from customers in these segments. </p>

			<h4><b><u>Misunderstanding the Role of Price</u></b></h4>
			<p>The discussion above alluded to the fact that those in poverty often start ventures where they seek advantage by offering low prices.  One of the biggest errors made by these entrepreneurs is the tendency to underprice.  If the venture’s only advantage is low price, then it probably has no advantage, as sooner or later someone else will offer an even lower price. In addition, the low price results in low margins, and when combined with low volumes, reinvesting in the business becomes problematic.</p>
			<p>A fundamental misunderstanding frequently occurs when it comes to pricing. The assumption is made that prices should be set in a manner that covers costs and produces a margin---such that the key driver of the price is the entrepreneur’s costs.  Price should not be a statement of costs, but rather, a statement of value.  Value is in the mind of the customer.  Unfortunately, low income entrepreneurs will tend to underprice because they undervalue what they are providing to customers.</p>
			<p>Howard Schulz, who went from poverty to create the global success story of Starbucks, not only understood the value concept, but made it a core element in the firm’s successful strategy.  Early on, he priced a cup of coffee at a level more than twice that being charged by many competitors. His price was not driven by his costs, but by the value created through differentiation. And he achieved this differentiation by convincing customers he was not simply selling coffee, but creating a lifestyle experience. </p>
			<p>Once prices are set low, or cut, it is hard to raise them. This is one more reason to err on the side of mid-range or higher pricing.  With higher prices, it is always possible to temporarily reduce prices to stimulate sales or if circumstances otherwise call for it. The creative entrepreneur looks for ways to do so without permanently cutting price.  So the list price remains the same, but what is actually charged is lowered through discounts, coupons, rebates, sales promotions, or special offers. </p>
			<p>Low income entrepreneurs also tend to charge uniform prices to all customers. They can fail to appreciate the idea that customers vary in their price sensitivities and the value they perceive in a given product or service.  One only has to consider how an airline may charge different prices to every customer on a given flight, even though it costs no more to fly one customer versus another.  The entrepreneur selling lawn and landscaping services may find that simply charging a fixed rate based on the size of the yard or the number of hours involved produces far less revenue than charging different prices to different segments based on their price sensitivities.</p>
