			<h4><b><u>Introduction</b></u></h4>
			<p>Businesses earn profits in different ways. Even two companies in the same industry may find there are significant differences in the way in which they are able to make a profit.  We can refer to this as the logic of profit---it concerns what has to happen to four key operating variables in order for the company to make money.  Many company founders, particularly in the early days of operations, are not consciously aware of their profit model, and this can doom the low income entrepreneur. </p>
			<p>The four variables of interest are margins, volumes, operating leverage (i.e., the cost structure), and revenue capture (see Figure 1). We start with <b><i>margins</b></i>, or the contribution that each product or service makes towards profitability once the direct cost of that service or product has been covered.  So margins are the price a customer pays minus the cost to the business of providing that product or service.  What affects a product or service’s margins?  Margins can be manipulated by finding more efficient ways of making or providing the product/service, or by adding value to a product/service so that the entrepreneur can raise the prices.</p>

			<p>Second, <b><i>volumes</b></i> capture the activity levels in the business. Volumes deal with the number transactions the business has over a period of time (e.g., daily, monthly) and the average value or quantity sold per transaction.  A comparison of two types of restaurants will make this clear.  A fast food restaurant operates on the premise that it charges low prices for relatively standardized goods produced en masse and will have high volumes or a large number of transactions per day.  Conversely, an exotic high-end restaurant will emphasize customized service, a relaxed, luxurious atmosphere, and a talented chef.  This high-end restaurant will expect to have much lower volumes than a fast food establishment, but will expect the value of each transaction (and hence the margins) to be much higher.  Expected volumes affect such decisions as staffing needs, quantities to keep in inventory, and space requirements. Once these decisions are made, they limit how much activity the business can handle.</p>
			<p>The third variable that determines the firm’s profit model is termed <b><i>operating leverage</b></i>, or the firm’s cost structure.  The basic question here is the extent to which the overall cost structure consists primarily of fixed costs or of variable costs.  A firm with high fixed costs has high operating leverage, where one having costs that are predominantly variable has low operating leverage.  Variable costs are those that change in direct proportion to the core activity of the firm.  For a factory, the core activity is units produced; for a web-based business, it might be transaction on the website; for a law firm, it might be billable hours. Examples include direct labor hours or cost of materials.  Fixed costs are those that remain the same regardless of activity levels within the firm, such as rent, salaries, depreciation, and insurance. We can think of them as the firm’s overhead. When starting a venture, having more fixed costs means the entrepreneur has increased risk.  Volumes or margins must be high to offset high fixed costs. These costs are incurred and have to be paid, regardless of whether or not sales are being generated. With high fixed costs, it takes longer to reach breakeven, but once there, the firm makes a more profit.  Thus, profits are more volatile when the firm has high operating leverage. Stated differently, slight changes in revenue lead to much more significant changes in profitability.</p>
			<p>The final question concerns how the firm <b><i>captures revenue</b></i>.  This includes how many revenue drivers the firm has, and how flexible the pricing is of these drivers. Revenue drivers refer to all of the major ways in which the company makes money.  Consider an automobile dealership.  Money might be generated from car sales, auto leases, repairs, parts, and warranties.  In this instance, the dealer has five revenue drivers.  Revenue drivers include everything that generates revenue, and so can be thought of as the firm’s major product and service lines. Hence, a restaurant with 150 items on the menu, or a hardware store with thousands of individual products, organizes these items into a more manageable set of revenue drivers, such as entrees versus alcoholic beverages at the restaurant, or hand tools versus lumber at the hardware store. </b>
			<p>Both revenue and profit will likely vary across the different revenue drivers.  Some drivers may be what are called ‘loss leaders’.  Some may exist simply to provide a full line or enable the positioning of the firm.  One revenue driver may exist to support sales of other drivers. For example, our dealership may make relatively little money on the cars, while earning most of its profits from parts and service.  Similarly, a copier company finds margins are steadily decreasing on their line of copiers as customers begin to view the product as a commodity.  However, most of those who buy a copier also buy service contract, where margins are quite high. So the entrepreneur prices his copiers low (perhaps at breakeven), but sells more service contracts as a result, and on balance makes a good profit. </p>
			<p>Also important for revenue capture is the flexibility of how these drivers are priced.  Pricing can be fixed or flexible. It is fixed when the firm offers its goods at a standard, published price, such as the menu in a restaurant.  There is no variation or negotiation.  With flexible pricing the entrepreneur able to modify prices depending on when the product is purchased, who is purchasing it, how much they are purchasing, or what other products they are purchasing (e.g., product bundling).  Hence, a restaurant might have a fixed price menu, but when it does catering, it negotiates prices.  Flexible pricing can give the entrepreneur more creative leeway to capitalize on market opportunities, optimize capacity utilization, and maximize overall revenue.  This is why, if a passenger on an airplane flight asked any five of their fellow passengers what price they paid for their ticket, it is likely they will get five different numbers. </p>

			<h4><u><b>Connecting the Dots</b></u></h4>
			<p>The profit model concerns how these four variables, when combined, affect the firm’s ability to make money.  The interactions among the variables are illustrated in Figure 12.2.  It centers on margins and volumes. Consider a business that sells furniture and has high (over 100%), medium (40-60%), or low (10-15% or less) margins. Assume the same business has high (sells 50 pieces of furniture a day, on average), medium (sells 20 pieces of furniture a day), or low (sells 4 pieces of furniture a day).  A global chain like IKEA makes money with high volumes and medium margins, while a local specialty retailer selling high end furniture is succeeding based on low volumes but high margins. If the entrepreneur has a high volume but low margin business, a decent profit might be earned.  The same would be the case for a low volume but high margin business.  Things look even better with high margins or volumes combined with medium volumes or margins. While it rarely happens, the company that can achieve both high volumes and high margins is going to make huge profits. Apple Computer and the iPhone would be an example. The problem with many low income entrepreneurs, as we shall see, is that they are running ventures with low volumes and margins, which is not sustainable. </p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tU9uV25.png" class="centerimg">
			<p>Next we factor in the cost structure of the venture.  If the business has a lot of fixed costs, again either the margins or the volumes need to be relatively high, and the other should be at least medium. The goal is to spread the fixed costs over as many transactions as possible. A company like Tesla that makes electric cars, which has very high fixed expenses (e.g., salaries, a manufacturing plant, dealerships, and marketing) has relatively high prices, but struggles to turn a profit because it costs a lot to make each car (variable costs) and volumes are relative low. </p>
			<p>Finally, we factor in the way the firm captures revenue.  A business that is experiencing a profit problem in terms of its combination of margins, volumes and fixed costs is in even worse share if it only has a single revenue driver. The entrepreneur may be able to improve the picture by adding revenue drivers, or moving to negotiated prices.  Consider a person who owns a small submarine sandwich business located near a university.  Fixed costs are relative high due to rent, a manager’s salary, insurance and marketing costs.  Margins are low as prices are kept down by fairly intense competition.  Having a good location is producing decent volumes, but these volumes fall off dramatically during the Summer and the Christmas holiday period, when students are gone.   This combination has the business barely making any profit.  Turning this situation around might involve the addition of a new revenue driver. Perhaps a catering service is added, which serves to offset seasonal fluctuations in sales volume, while also offering higher margins. </p>

			<h4><u><b>The Profit Challenge with Ventures of the Poor</b></u></h4>
			<p>The first challenge with low income entrepreneurs is knowing whether they are actually earning a profit. Poor financial literacy and/or lack of discipline in properly recording revenue as it is received and expenses as they are incurred can lead to uncertainty regarding profit performance.  Not having a precise sense of the unit cost of an item, or how much has to be charged to cover the overhead of the business, finds many entrepreneurs charging prices that are below costs for some of their items. It is also important to be able to break profits down by product, customer type, and sales channel. For instance, not knowing which products generate higher profits, or whether more money is made from online versus retail store sales, results in the low income entrepreneur allocating too much time and money on the wrong things.</p>
			<p>While this knowledge is vital, it is just as important to understand the logic of how the firm makes its money. For the low income entrepreneur, the profit model serves as a critical indicator of the relative attractiveness of the venture.  A model with low volumes, low margins, high operating leverage, and a single revenue driver at a fixed price is going to lose money. A much more attractive economic model would be one where margins are high, volumes are medium to high, operating leverage is medium, and the firm has multiple revenue drivers with considerable price flexibility.  The profit model framework can serve as a type of diagnostic tool, where entrepreneurs can identify ways to improve the economic attractiveness of the venture.</p>
			<p>The profit model helps explain the struggles of many low income. These ventures tend to experience low margins.  Frequently, both prices and unit costs are the culprits. Consider some possible reasons why an entrepreneur who is poor would keep their prices low: </p>
			<p>•They think it is only fair to charge an affordable price;</p>
			<p>•It is what they and their neighbors can afford;</p>
			<p>•They are more worried about covering costs than earning margins;</p>
			<p>•They face intense competition;</p>
			<p>•They underestimate what the product or service is really worth;</p>
			<p>•They assume a low price is only potential source of advantage.</p>
			<p>While the price will push the margins down, so too will high unit costs. Here, the problem is traceable to three considerations. First, low income entrepreneurs tend to create labor intensive ventures and do not (or are unable to) incorporate technology and advanced equipment into their operating processes. Second, their ventures often produce low volumes, keeping their cost per unit relatively high. Third, they are unable to purchase raw materials, ingredients, or inventory at wholesale prices or in the kinds of quantities that would qualify them for sizable discounts. </p>
			<p>Low volumes are attributable to lack of production capacity within the business, intense competition in the local market, trying to operate in a relatively mature market, and a lack of large buyers. A case in point would be the low income entrepreneur who establishes a hair salon. The business is trying to earn profits in a fairly saturated market experiencing low growth in overall sales, and the sales volume has to be shared by a large number of players. The entrepreneur might assume that low prices would attract more customers, but this is rarely the case for the ventures of the poor. </p>
			<p>Operating leverage tends not to be as much of a problem, as the poor simply cannot afford to pay high rents or salaries, spend a lot on marketing, or buy a lot of equipment. These ventures will be quite lean when it comes to overhead.  Of course, not spending money here contributes to low volumes and high unit costs, so it can be a kind of catch-22. Even here, though, the low income entrepreneur can find they pay more for a piece of equipment or on other fixed costs because of their low bargaining power, lack of credit history, and with such expenses as insurance, because of the neighborhoods where they operate. </p>
			<p>Limitations to revenue capture also affect poor entrepreneurs.  Resource constraints (money, space, time, knowledge) can limit the mix of products and services sold by their ventures.  Adding a product can require more investment in inventory and marketing. In our example above involving the restaurant, even adding something like catering can be difficult, as it may require a delivery vehicle, equipment to keep food warm or cold, and more insurance. The skill set to manage a catering business may differ significantly from the entrepreneur’s current capabilities. The marketing requirements are also likely to differ. Finally, the new products or services can take a lot of the entrepreneur’s time, such that existing parts of the business begin to suffer. </p>
			<br></br><br></br><br></br>
			
			<h4><u><b>Creating More Profitable and Sustainable Ventures</b></u></h4>
			<p>The ability of the poor to develop high earning ventures that have real growth potential can be facilitated in a number of ways.  Key facilitators include creativity and imagination, financial insight, resource leveraging and bootstrapping, use of low cost technologies, and strategic focus.  Let us apply these facilitators to the variables in the profit model (see also Table 1): </p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>a. Margins</b></i></h5>
			<p>Increasing margins must be a top priority of the low income entrepreneur, important in its own right, but in many cases easier to achieve than manipulations of the other three variables.  From a pricing vantage point, low income entrepreneurs need to be willing to price more on the basis of how much value they are providing to different types of customers than based on their estimated unit costs.  They must go beyond just focusing on the customers that are most price sensitive (often the people in their neighborhoods), or assuming all customers are equally price sensitive.  Further, the ability to charge more is tied to successful differentiation of the business.  Creative pricing can also improve the picture.  Examples include:</p>
			<p>•a low base price and sell add-ons at high margin</p>
			<p>•pricing differently at low or high peak times</p>
			<p>•unlimited use of product or service for a flat fee</p>
			<p>•base price and then variable charges once a threshold is reached</p>
			<p>•different prices for different market segments</p>
			<p>•loyalty schemes for past or heavy users</p>
			<p>•price differences for users who can only buy/use at certain periods</p>
			<p>•prices tied to customer characteristics, such as size of their family, house or car</p>
			<p>•bundled pricing for multiple items</p>
			<p>•cash and quantity discounts</p>
			<p>•trade-in/trade-up schemes</p>
			<p>The other side of the equation is finding ways to reduce the variable costs of the goods being sold. The possibilities here are tied to a) finding ways to produce the product or service in a less labor intensive manner by using more efficient labor practices, incorporating more or better equipment, or automating tasks, and b) reducing costs of materials or goods purchased. The low income entrepreneur must bring a philosophy of efficiency to every aspect of what they are doing---developing an intimate feel for the flow of how every task is done and how each task contributes to a well-run operation. There are a number of areas that can be focused upon that can significantly bring down costs, from breaking down and systematizing tasks and establishing standard procedures to eliminating clutter and having the right things in the right places. Although buying industrial grade equipment may be too expensive in the early days of the business, a leveraging strategy can be employed to borrow, share, barter to obtain, or rent the equipment and possible the technologies belonging to other parties. With procurement, economies can come from shopping around, purchasing in larger lot sizes, buying in tandem with other small businesses, and buying on consignment.</p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>b. Volumes</b></i></h5>
			<p>The ability to increase the volume of sales or transactions in the business requires creativity both in defining target markets and in expanding capacity. The core market being served is often too small or being served by too many other firms. The low income entrepreneur must look for additional niches where, with a little value added, new sales can be accomplished.  For instance, an entrepreneur opens a paint ball facility where customers compete on teams to defeat other teams by shooting them with dye-filled gelatin capsules. The target market is teenagers, but this limits volume on the days when school is in session.  The entrepreneur recognizes that companies might utilize the facility on school days as an employee team-building exercise, and adapts operations and marketing approaches to attract them.  Another entrepreneur has a cake-making business that concentrates on specialty cakes for weddings and formal events. She starts looking for additional niches, and finds sales can be considerable augmented by specializing in church socials, and a monthly program addressing employee birthdays at companies.</p>
			<p>A major issue affecting volumes is the extent to which the entrepreneur is customizing their offering to individual clients. Customization requires time and money and so significantly limits capacity. Anxious to attract and please customers, some business owners will add customized features or provide tailored services such as personal delivery without charging for these things (and when charging a low price to begin with). Higher customization means the profit model must center on lower volumes and higher margins, while a more standardized offering is more associated with higher volumes and relatively lower margins. It is a relationship that low income entrepreneurs can find themselves on the wrong side of. </p>
			<p>Capacity can also be expanded by augmenting one’s facilities and equipment.  Again, leveraging comes into play, where the entrepreneur seeks to share the facilities or equipment of others. Using another company’s machines during down time, sharing space in someone’s warehouse, borrowing a truck after hours, or outsourcing parts of the work can enable the entrepreneur produce more without making big investments.</p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>c. Operating Leverage (Cost Structure)</b></i></h5>
			<p>Reducing fixed costs can be the most difficult variable to address in the profit model.  Most low income entrepreneurs are operating on a very lean basis to begin with, and simply cannot afford to spend a lot on rent, the purchase of capital equipment, salaries, or marketing. So, there is not much to cut. Again, however, using the assets of others and outsourcing can serve as methods for reducing fixed costs. Similarly, clever guerrilla tactics can bring down marketing costs. Taking advantage of the increasing availability of low cost technology is yet another way to avoid or lessen overhead costs. </p>
			<br></br>
			
			<h5><i><b>d. Revenue Capture</b></i></h5>
			<p>Finally, the low income entrepreneur is continually looking for different ways to capture revenue, both in terms of how the customer is charged, and the different products and services being provided.  Making a premium version of one’s service available, charging a subscription rate rather than pay-as-you-go, offering an extended warranty, or adding a product that complements or augments the entrepreneur’s basic product are a few examples. </p>
			<p>In closing, the reality is that the poor need not start marginal businesses that have unattractive profit models and do not grow.  The key is continual experimentation with the profit model framework presented here.  With insight, ongoing learning, imagination, engagement in different resource leveraging approaches, clever use of new technologies, and a guerilla mindset, the low income entrepreneur can produce much more and achieve greater efficiencies, while realizing larger returns on their efforts.</p>

				<h4><u><b>Table 1:  Key Questions Surrounding the Profit Model</b></u></h4>
				<p>As the low income entrepreneur tries to arrive at a profit model that will sustain the business, he/she should be experimenting with each of the four variables that constitute the model.  Here are examples of key questions to be continually addressed:</p>
				<br></br>
				
				<!--Note: Changed the names and orders of the headers compared to provided document. I think he just made a copy-paste error, as it's not the first mistake I've found.-->
				
				<h5><i><b>Margins:</b></i></h5>
				<p>o Are my margins relatively low (e.g., a grocery store) or high (e.g., a jewelry store)?</p>
				<p>o Does my business add significant value to the products or services, enhancing the brand?</p>
				<p>o Might I be able to make higher margins by selling to different kinds of customers?</p>
				<p>o Could I offer customized services which would allow me to charge significantly higher prices?</p>
				<p>o Are there ways to cut unit costs by buying in larger quantities, purchasing from lower cost suppliers, using more equipment, or incorporating technology into my business processes?</p>
				<br></br>
				
				<h5><i><b>Volumes:</b></i></h5>
				<p>o Do I have significant capacity constraints?</p>
				<p>o Am I a relatively high, medium or low volume business?</p>
				<p>o Do I offer highly customized services which decreases the volumes I can process, or are my goods and services very standardized allowing me to increase my business’s volumes?</p>
				<p>o How saturated is the overall market?</p>
				<p>o What quantity of items am I sellling relative to the competition over a specific time period?</p>
				<p>o What is the average value of a transaction in my business and how does that fare against competition? Are there ways to get people to spend more per visit?</p>
				<br></br>
				
				<h5><i><b>Operating Leverage (Cost Structure):</b></i></h5>
				<p>o What proportion of my costs are fixed versus variable?</p>
				<p>o Are there any key fixed costs I can reduce, such as by operating from home, in a smaller facility, or in a borrowed space?</p>
				<p>o Can I eliminate salaries and just pay people on an hourly basis?</p>
				<p>o Could I do more outsource of parts of my business so as to convert certain fixed costs into variable costs?</p>
				<br></br>
				
				<h5><i><b>Revenue Capture:</b></i></h5>
				<p>o Do I have a wide variety of revenue drivers or only a few?</p>
				<p>o Are there other creative ways to capture revenue?</p>
				<p>o Can I make some of my prices negotiable or subject to a quote?</p>
				<p>o How often do I change my prices?  Is it frequently (hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly)? Moderately frequently (monthly, bimonthly)? Or rarely (semiannually, annually or longer)?</p>
				<p>o Might I use product or service bundling, different prices for different market segments, pricing based on customer loyalty, or other creative tactics?</p>
